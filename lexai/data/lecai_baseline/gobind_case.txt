IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

Gobind v. State of Madhya Pradesh
(1975) 2 SCC 148

JUDGMENT

The right to privacy in any event will necessarily have to go through a process of case-by-case development. The claim to privacy must be weighed against other important interests such as public interest.

A mere announcement of a privilege against the State will not conclude the matter but the question would be whether in a given situation a claimed right is entitled to protection.

The right to personal liberty takes in not only a right to be free from restrictions placed on movements, but also free from encroachments on private life.

This Court refers to Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. where certain aspects of privacy were discussed in the context of police surveillance.

While we recognize privacy as an important value, it must be balanced with legitimate state interests in maintaining public order and security.
