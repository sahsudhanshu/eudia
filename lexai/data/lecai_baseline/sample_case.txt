IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1234 OF 2020

Privacy Rights Case v. Union of India

JUDGMENT

This case concerns the fundamental right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The petitioners challenge the constitutionality of a surveillance program on grounds that it violates their fundamental rights.

The Court notes that the right to privacy has been recognized as a fundamental right in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017) 10 SCC 1. In that landmark decision, a nine-judge bench held that privacy is a constitutionally protected right which emerges primarily from the guarantee of life and personal liberty in Article 21.

This Court also relies on Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) 1 SCC 248, which established that Article 21 confers a fundamental right to life and personal liberty, and that the procedure established by law must be right, just and fair.

Furthermore, in Gobind v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1975) 2 SCC 148, this Court observed that the right to privacy must be weighed against other important interests such as public interest.

The Court also refers to Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. (1963) 1 SCC 614, where it was held that domiciliary visits by the police without warrant are an intrusion into a person's right to be left alone.

After considering the precedents, this Court holds that the surveillance program violates the fundamental right to privacy as it lacks adequate safeguards. The petition is allowed.
