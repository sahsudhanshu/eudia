IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India
(2017) 10 SCC 1

JUDGMENT

The question before this Court is whether the right to privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.

Privacy is essential to human dignity and autonomy. It protects individuals from state and non-state intrusions. The right to privacy must be read as a part of Article 21 which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.

This right includes the right to make intimate personal choices and control dissemination of personal information. Privacy includes preservation of personal intimacies, the sanctity of family life, marriage, procreation, the home and sexual orientation.

The Court relies on international instruments including Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

We hold that the right to privacy is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.
