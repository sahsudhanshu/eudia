IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India
(1978) 1 SCC 248

JUDGMENT

Article 21 confers a fundamental right to life and personal liberty. The right to life is not merely confined to physical existence but includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it.

The procedure established by law must be right, just and fair, not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive. The procedure contemplated by Article 21 must answer the test of reasonableness.

This Court held in Gopalan v. State of Madras that the rights under Article 21 and Article 19 are mutually exclusive. However, we now overrule that aspect of the decision.

The expression "personal liberty" in Article 21 is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of man.
