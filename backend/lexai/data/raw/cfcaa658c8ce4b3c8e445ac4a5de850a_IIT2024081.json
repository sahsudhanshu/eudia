The dataset captures clinical and\ndemographic predictors associated with the conversion of Clinically Isolated\nSyndrome (CIS) to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in Mexican mestizo patients treated\nbetween 2006 and 2010 at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery,\nMexico City.\nQuestion 1: Exploratory Analysis of the CIS Dataset\nDataset Overview\n\u2022 Observations: 273 patients. Row identifiers in the source file were treated as\nrow names to preserve patient IDs without using them in computations.\n\u2022 Key variables:\n\u2013 Gender (1 = male, 2 = female).\n\u2013 Age (years at CIS diagnosis).\n\u2013 Initial_Symptom (categorised index of first clinical presentation).\n\u2013 Oligoclonal_Bands (0 = negative, 1 = positive, 2 = strongly positive /\nrepeated positivity).\n\u2013 Neurophysiological indicators (LLSSEP, ULSSEP, VEP, BAEP).\n\u2013 MRI findings across brain and spinal cord regions.\n\u2013 Disability metrics (Initial_EDSS, Final_EDSS), reported for patients who\nconverted to MS (group = 1).\n\u2013 group (1 = converted to MS, 2 = remained CIS).\n\u2022 Missingness: Schooling and Initial_Symptom each have one missing value.\nInitial_EDSS and Final_EDSS are unavailable for 148 patients (all in group = 2).\nNo other variables contain missing entries.\n\u2022 Clinical context: The combination of MRI and neurophysiological measures\nenables the joint analysis of inflammatory burden and electrophysiological\nresponse, both of which are relevant to conversion risk.\n1.2 Data Import and Cleaning\n1.3 Descriptive Statistics\nMetric Age\nMean 34.0623\nMedian 33\nMode 28\nStandard 11.1144\ndeviation\nVariance 123.529\nSkewness 0.6981\nKurtosis 0.4244\n\nOutput\n1.4 Visual Exploration\n\nObservations: -\n\u2022 Age clusters between late 20s and mid-30s, with the histogram peaking around 25-\n35 and tapering gradually toward older ages; very few observations below 20 or\nabove 60.\n\u2022 Distribution skews slightly right: a tail extends into the 60-70 range, but counts fall\nquickly. The stacked dot plot\u2019s mean line lies just right of the median, confirming\nmild positive skew.\n\u2022 Age values are almost all integers, so the dot plot reveals \u201ccolumns\u201d of stacked\npoints at each whole age-no large gaps, suggesting consistent recording across ages.\n\u2022 The maximum stack height is modest (fewer than 15 observations per exact age),\nindicating no single age dominates the cohort.\nQuestion 2: Binomial Distribution Modelling\nBasis of Distribution Selection:\nLast digit of Enrolment Number: 1\nBinomial Distribution and Poisson approximation to Binomial..\n2.1 Sampling, PMF, and CDF Visualisations\nRandom samples from the Binomial distribution illustrate convergence behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Sample vs Theoretical Moments\nThe empirical mean and variance approach theoretical values as sample size grows. Small-\nsample variance can oscillate around the theoretical variance, as evidenced by the 30-draw\nsample.\n2.3 Poisson Approximation to the Binomial\nObservations\n\u2022 Binomial PMFs and CDFs align closely with theory; as n grows the mass\nspreads smoothly and the CDF transitions sharpen-symmetric\nabout np when p = 0.6, skewed left/right for p = 0.3/0.9.\n\u2022 Expanded sample size tightens empirical dispersion around the theoretical\nmean and variance, mirroring the moment table, all four raw moments differ\nfrom expectations by well under 1%, demonstrating simulation stability.\n\u2022 Higher-order moment deviations increase mildly with larger n and extreme p,\nconsistent with sampling noise concentrated near the distribution boundaries.\n\u2022 Poisson overlays show a strong approximation when p = 0.3 (classic \u201crare\nevent\u201d regime). The gap widens for p = 0.6 and becomes pronounced at p =\n0.9, illustrating the sensitivity of the approximation to large success\nprobabilities.\n\u2022 Overall, the grid confirms that sample moments converge to theory with\nlarger n, and that Poisson is only a good surrogate for Binomial when p is small\nwhile np remains moderate."
