The issue reaches out to the foundation of a\nconstitutional culture based on the protection of human rights and enables this Court\nto revisit the basic principles on which our Constitution has been founded and their\nconsequences for a way of life it seeks to protect. This case presents challenges for\nconstitutional interpretation. If privacy is to be construed as a protected constitutional\nvalue, it would redefine in significant ways our concepts of liberty and the entitlements\nthat flow out of its protection.\n2 Privacy, in its simplest sense, allows each human being to be left alone in a\ncore which is inviolable. Yet the autonomy of the individual is conditioned by her\nrelationships with the rest of society. Those relationships may and do often pose\nquestions to autonomy and free choice. The overarching presence of state and non-\nstate entities regulates aspects of social existence which bear upon the freedom of\nthe individual. The preservation of constitutional liberty is, so to speak, work in\nprogress. Challenges have to be addressed to existing problems. Equally, new\nchallenges have to be dealt with in terms of a constitutional understanding of where\nliberty places an individual in the context of a social order. The emergence of new\nchallenges is exemplified by this case, where the debate on privacy is being analysed\nin the context of a global information based society. In an age where information\ntechnology governs virtually every aspect of our lives, the task before the Court is to\n4\nPART A\nimpart constitutional meaning to individual liberty in an interconnected world. While\nwe revisit the question whether our constitution protects privacy as an elemental\nprinciple, the Court has to be sensitive to the needs of and the opportunities and\ndangers posed to liberty in a digital world.\n3 A Bench of three judges of this Court, while considering the constitutional\nchallenge to the Aadhaar card scheme of the Union government noted in its order\ndated 11 August 2015 that the norms for and compilation of demographic biometric\ndata by government was questioned on the ground that it violates the right to privacy.\nThe Attorney General for India urged that the existence of a fundamental right of\nprivacy is in doubt in view of two decisions : the first \u2013 M P Sharma v Satish Chandra,\nDistrict Magistrate, Delhi1 (\u201cM P Sharma\u201d) was rendered by a Bench of eight\njudges and the second, in Kharak Singh v State of Uttar Pradesh2 (\u201cKharak\nSingh\u201d) was rendered by a Bench of six judges. Each of these decisions, in the\nsubmission of the Attorney General, contained observations that the Indian\nConstitution does not specifically protect the right to privacy. On the other hand, the\nsubmission of the petitioners was that M P Sharma and Kharak Singh were founded\non principles expounded in A K Gopalan v State of Madras3 (\u201cGopalan\u201d). Gopalan,\nwhich construed each provision contained in the Chapter on fundamental rights as\nembodying a distinct protection, was held not to be good law by an eleven-judge\n1 (1954) SCR 1077\n2 (1964) 1 SCR 332\n3 AIR 1950 SC 27\n5\nPART A\nBench in Rustom Cavasji Cooper v Union of India4 (\u201cCooper\u201d). Hence the\npetitioners submitted that the basis of the two earlier decisions is not valid. Moreover,\nit was also urged that in the seven-judge Bench decision in Maneka Gandhi v Union\nof India5 (\u201cManeka\u201d), the minority judgment of Justice Subba Rao in Kharak Singh\nwas specifically approved of and the decision of the majority was overruled.\n4 While addressing these challenges, the Bench of three judges of this Court took\nnote of several decisions of this Court in which the right to privacy has been held to\nbe a constitutionally protected fundamental right. Those decisions include : Gobind\nv State of Madhya Pradesh6 (\u201cGobind\u201d), R Rajagopal v State of Tamil Nadu7\n(\u201cRajagopal\u201d) and People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties v Union of India8 (\u201cPUCL\u201d).\nThese subsequent decisions which affirmed the existence of a constitutionally\nprotected right of privacy, were rendered by Benches of a strength smaller than those\nin M P Sharma and Kharak Singh. Faced with this predicament and having due\nregard to the far-reaching questions of importance involving interpretation of the\nConstitution, it was felt that institutional integrity and judicial discipline would require\na reference to a larger Bench. Hence the Bench of three learned judges observed in\nits order dated 11 August 2015:\n\u201c12. We are of the opinion that the cases on hand raise far reaching\nquestions of importance involving interpretation of the Constitution.\n4 (1970) 1 SCC 248\n5 (1978) 1 SCC 248\n6 (1975) 2 SCC 148\n7 (1994) 6 SCC 632\n8 (1997) 1 SCC 301\n6\nPART A\nWhat is at stake is the amplitude of the fundamental rights including\nthat precious and inalienable right under Article 21. If the\nobservations made in M.P. Sharma (supra) and Kharak Singh\n(supra) are to be read literally and accepted as the law of this\ncountry, the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution\nof India and more particularly right to liberty under Article 21 would\nbe denuded of vigour and vitality. At the same time, we are also of\nthe opinion that the institutional integrity and judicial discipline\nrequire that pronouncement made by larger Benches of this Court\ncannot be ignored by the smaller Benches without appropriately\nexplaining the reasons for not following the pronouncements made\nby such larger Benches. With due respect to all the learned Judges\nwho rendered the subsequent judgments - where right to privacy is\nasserted or referred to their Lordships concern for the liberty of\nhuman beings, we are of the humble opinion that there appears to\nbe certain amount of apparent unresolved contradiction in the law\ndeclared by this Court.\n13. Therefore, in our opinion to give a quietus to the kind of\ncontroversy raised in this batch of cases once for all, it is better that\nthe ratio decidendi of M.P. Sharma (supra) and Kharak Singh\n(supra) is scrutinized and the jurisprudential correctness of the\nsubsequent decisions of this Court where the right to privacy is\neither asserted or referred be examined and authoritatively decided\nby a Bench of appropriate strength.\u201d\n5 On 18 July 2017, a Constitution Bench presided over by the learned Chief\nJustice considered it appropriate that the issue be resolved by a Bench of nine judges.\nThe order of the Constitution Bench reads thus:\n\u201cDuring the course of the hearing today, it seems that it has become\nessential for us to determine whether there is any fundamental right\nof privacy under the Indian Constitution. The determination of this\nquestion would essentially entail whether the decision recorded by\nthis Court in M.P. Sharma and Ors. vs. Satish Chandra, District\nMagistrate, Delhi and Ors. - 1950 SCR 1077 by an eight-Judge\nConstitution Bench, and also, in Kharak Singh vs. The State of\nU.P. and Ors. - 1962 (1) SCR 332 by a six-Judge Constitution\nBench, that there is no such fundamental right, is the correct\nexpression of the constitutional position.\n7\nPART A\nBefore dealing with the matter any further, we are of the view that\nthe issue noticed hereinabove deserves to be placed before the\nnine-Judge Constitution Bench. List these matters before the Nine-\nJudge Constitution Bench on 19.07.2017.\u201d\n6 During the course of hearing, we have been ably assisted on behalf of the\npetitioners by Mr Gopal Subramanium, Mr Kapil Sibal, Mr Arvind Datar, Mr Shyam\nDivan, Mr Anand Grover, Ms Meenakshi Arora, Mr Sajan Poovayya and Mr Jayant\nBhushan, learned senior counsel. Mr J S Attri, learned senior counsel supported them\non behalf of the State of Himachal Pradesh. On behalf of the Union of India, the Court\nhas had the benefit of the erudite submissions of Mr K K Venugopal, Attorney General\nfor India. He has been ably supported by Mr Tushar Mehta, Additional Solicitor\nGeneral, Mr Rakesh Dwivedi, senior counsel for the State of Gujarat, Mr Aryama\nSundaram for the State of Maharashtra, Mr Gopal Sankaranarayanan and Dr Arghya\nSengupta respectively. While some state governments have supported the stand of\nthe Union government, others have supported the petitioners.\n7 The correctness of the decisions in M P Sharma and Kharak Singh, is to be\nevaluated during the course of the reference. Besides, the jurisprudential correctness\nof subsequent decisions holding the right to privacy to be a constitutionally protected\nright is to be determined. The basic question whether privacy is a right protected\nunder our Constitution requires an understanding of what privacy means. For it is\nwhen we understand what interests or entitlements privacy safeguards, that we can\ndetermine whether the Constitution protects privacy. The contents of privacy need to\n8\nPART B\nbe analysed, not by providing an exhaustive enunciation or catalogue of what it\nincludes but by indicating its broad contours. The Court has been addressed on\nvarious aspects of privacy including : (i) Whether there is a constitutionally protected\nright to privacy; (ii) If there is a constitutionally protected right, whether this has the\ncharacter of an independent fundamental right or whether it arises from within the\nexisting guarantees of protected rights such as life and personal liberty; (iii) the\ndoctrinal foundations of the claim to privacy; (iv) the content of privacy; and (v) the\nnature of the regulatory power of the state.\nB Decision in M P Sharma\n8 An investigation was ordered by the Union government under the Companies\nAct into the affairs of a company which was in liquidation on the ground that it had\nmade an organized attempt to embezzle its funds and to conceal the true state of its\naffairs from the share-holders and on the allegation that the company had indulged in\nfraudulent transactions and falsified its records. Offences were registered and search\nwarrants were issued during the course of which, records were seized. The challenge\nwas that the searches violated the fundamental rights of the petitioners under Article\n19(1)(f) and Article 20(3) of the Constitution. The former challenge was rejected. The\nquestion which this Court addressed was whether there was a contravention of Article\n20(3). Article 20(3) mandates that no person accused of an offence shall be compelled\nto be a witness against himself. Reliance was placed on a judgment9 of the US\n9 Boyd v. United States, 116 US 616 (1886)\n9\nPART B\nSupreme Court holding that obtaining incriminating evidence by an illegal search and\nseizure violates the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the American Constitution. While\ntracing the history of Indian legislation, this Court observed that provisions for search\nwere contained in successive enactments of the Criminal Procedure Code. Justice\nJagannadhadas, speaking for the Bench, held that a search or seizure does not\ninfringe the constitutional right guaranteed by Article 20(3) of the Constitution:\n\u201c\u2026there is no basis in the Indian law for the assumption that a search\nor seizure of a thing or document is in itself to be treated as compelled\nproduction of the same. Indeed a little consideration will show that the\ntwo are essentially different matters for the purpose relevant to the\npresent discussion. A notice to produce is addressed to the party\nconcerned and his production in compliance therewith constitutes a\ntestimonial act by him within the meaning of Article 20(3) as above\nexplained. But a search warrant is addressed to an officer of the\nGovernment, generally a police officer. Neither the search nor the\nseizure are acts of the occupier of the searched premises. They are\nacts of another to which he is obliged to submit and are, therefore, not\nhis testimonial acts in any sense.\u201d10\n9 Having held that the guarantee against self-incrimination is not offended by a\nsearch and seizure, the Court observed that :\n\u201cA power of search and seizure is in any system of jurisprudence\nan overriding power of the State for the protection of social security\nand that power is necessarily regulated by law. When the\nConstitution makers have thought fit not to subject such\nregulation to constitutional limitations by recognition of a\nfundamental right to privacy, analogous to the Fourth\nAmendment, we have no justification to import it, into a totally\ndifferent fundamental right, by some process of strained\nconstruction. Nor is it legitimate to assume that the constitutional\n10 MP Sharma (Supra note 1), at page 1096\n10\nPART C\nprotection under Article 20(3) would be defeated by the statutory\nprovisions for searches.\u201d11 (emphasis supplied)\n10 These observations \u2013 to be more precise in one sentence - indicating that the\nConstitution makers did not subject the regulation by law of the power of search and\nseizure to a fundamental right of privacy, similar to the Fourth amendment of the US\nConstitution, have been pressed in aid to question the existence of a protected right\nto privacy under our Constitution.\nC Decision in Kharak Singh\n11 After being challaned in a case of dacoity in 1941, Kharak Singh was released\nfor want of evidence. But the police compiled a \u201chistory sheet\u201d against him. \u2018History\nsheets\u2019 were defined in Regulation 228 of Chapter XX of the U P Police Regulations\nas \u201cthe personal records of criminals under surveillance\u201d. Kharak Singh, who was\nsubjected to regular surveillance, including midnight knocks, moved this Court for a\ndeclaration that his fundamental rights were infringed. Among the measures of\nsurveillance contemplated by Regulation 236 were the following:\n\u201c(a) Secret picketing of the house or approaches to the houses of\nsuspects;\n(b) domiciliary visits at night;\n(c) thorough periodical inquiries by officers not below the rank of\nsub-inspector into repute, habits, associations, income, expenses\nand occupation;\n(d) the reporting by constables and chaukidars of movements and\nabsences from home;\n11 Ibid, at page 1096-97\n11\nPART C\n(c) the verification of movements and absences by means of inquiry\nslips;\n(f) the collection and record on a history-sheet of all information\nbearing on conduct.\u201d\n12 This Court held that the freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India,\nguaranteed by Article 19(1)(d) was not infringed by a midnight knock on the door of\nthe petitioner since \u201chis locomotion is not impeded or prejudiced in any manner\u201d.\n13 When the decision in Kharak Singh was handed down, the principles\ngoverning the inter-relationship between the rights protected by Article 19 and the\nright to life and personal liberty under Article 21 were governed by the judgment in\nGopalan. Gopalan considered each of the articles in the Chapter on fundamental\nrights as embodying distinct (as opposed to over-lapping) freedoms. Hence in Kharak\nSingh, the Court observed :\n\u201cIn view of the very limited nature of the question before us it is\nunnecessary to pause to consider either the precise relationship\nbetween the \u201cliberties\u201d in Article 19(1)(a) & (d) on the one hand and\nthat in Article 21 on the other, or the content and significance of the\nwords \u201cprocedure established by law\u201d in the latter Article, both of\nwhich were the subject of elaborate consideration by this Court\nin A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras.\u201d12\n14 The decision in Kharak Singh held that clause (b) of Regulation 236 which\nprovided for domiciliary visits at night was violative of Article 21. The Court observed:\n\u201cIs then the word \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d to be construed as excluding\nfrom its purview an invasion on the part of the police of the sanctity\n12 Kharak Singh (Supra note 2), at page 345\n12\nPART C\nof a man's home and an intrusion into his personal security and his\nright to sleep which is the normal comfort and a dire necessity for\nhuman existence even as an animal? It might not be inappropriate\nto refer here to the words of the preamble to the Constitution that it\nis designed to \u201cassure the dignity of the individual\u201d and therefore of\nthose cherished human values as the means of ensuring his full\ndevelopment and evolution. We are referring to these objectives of\nthe framers merely to draw attention to the concepts underlying the\nconstitution which would point to such vital words as \u201cpersonal\nliberty\u201d having to be construed in a reasonable manner and to be\nattributed that sense which would promote and achieve those\nobjectives and by no means to stretch the meaning of the phrase to\nsquare with any pre-conceived notions or doctrinaire constitutional\ntheories.\u201d13\n15 In taking this view, Justice Rajagopala Ayyangar, speaking for a majority of five\njudges, relied upon the judgment of Justice Frankfurter, speaking for the US Supreme\nCourt in Wolf v Colorado14, which held :\n\u201cThe security of one's privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the\npolice \u2026 is basic to a free society\u2026\nWe have no hesitation in saying that were a State affirmatively to\nsanction such police incursion into privacy it would run counter to\nthe guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d15 (emphasis supplied)\nWhile the Court observed that the Indian Constitution does not contain a guarantee\nsimilar to the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution, it proceeded to hold that :\n\u201cNevertheless, these extracts would show that an unauthorised\nintrusion into a person's home and the disturbance caused to\nhim thereby, is as it were the violation of a common law right of\na man an ultimate essential of ordered liberty, if not of the very\n13 Ibid, at pages 347-348\n14 338 US 25 (1949)\n15 Cited in Kharak Singh (Supra note 2), at page 348\n13\nPART C\nconcept of civilisation. An English Common Law maxim asserts that\n\u201cevery man's house is his castle\u201d and in Semayne case [5 Coke\n91 : 1 Sm LC (13th Edn) 104 at p. 105] where this was applied, it\nwas stated that \u201cthe house of everyone is to him as his castle\nand fortress as well as for his defence against injury and violence\nas for his repose\u201d. We are not unmindful of the fact that Semayne\ncase [(1604) 5 Coke 91 : 1 Sm LC (13th Edn) 104 at p. 105] was\nconcerned with the law relating to executions in England, but the\npassage extracted has a validity quite apart from the context of the\nparticular decision. It embodies an abiding principle which\ntranscends mere protection of property rights and expounds a\nconcept of \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d which does not rest on any element\nof feudalism or on any theory of freedom which has ceased to be of\nvalue.\u201d16 (emphasis supplied)\n16 Kharak Singh regards the sanctity of the home and the protection against\nunauthorized intrusion an integral element of \u201cordered liberty\u201d. This is comprised in\n\u2018personal liberty\u2019 guaranteed by Article 21. The decision invalidated domiciliary visits\nat night authorised by Regulation 236 (b), finding them to be an unauthorized intrusion\ninto the home of a person and a violation of the fundamental right to personal liberty.\nHowever, while considering the validity of clauses (c),(d) and (e) which provided for\nperiodical enquiries, reporting by law enforcement personnel and verification of\nmovements, this Court held as follows :\n\u201c\u2026the freedom guaranteed by Article 19(1)(d) is not infringed by a\nwatch being kept over the movements of the suspect. Nor do we\nconsider that Article 21 has any relevance in the context as was\nsought to be suggested by learned Counsel for the petitioner. As\nalready pointed out, the right of privacy is not a guaranteed right\nunder our Constitution and therefore the attempt to ascertain\nthe movements of an individual which is merely a manner in\n16 Ibid, at page 349\n14\nPART C\nwhich privacy is invaded is not an infringement of a\nfundamental right guaranteed by Part III.\u201d17 (emphasis supplied)\nIn the context of clauses (c), (d) and (e), the above extract indicates the view of the\nmajority that the right of privacy is not guaranteed under the Constitution.\n17 Justice Subba Rao dissented. Justice Subba Rao held that the rights conferred\nby Part III have overlapping areas. Where a law is challenged as infringing the right\nto freedom of movement under Article 19(1)(d) and the liberty of the individual under\nArticle 21, it must satisfy the tests laid down in Article 19(2) as well as the requirements\nof Article 21. Justice Subba Rao held that :\n\u201cNo doubt the expression \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d is a comprehensive one\nand the right to move freely is an attribute of personal liberty. It is\nsaid that the freedom to move freely is carved out of personal liberty\nand, therefore, the expression \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d in Article 21\nexcludes that attribute. In our view, this is not a correct approach.\nBoth are independent fundamental rights, though there is\noverlapping. There is no question of one being carved out of\nanother. The fundamental right of life and personal liberty have\nmany attributes and some of them are found in Article 19. If a\nperson's fundamental right under Article 21 is infringed, the State\ncan rely upon a law to sustain the action; but that cannot be a\ncomplete answer unless the said law satisfies the test laid down in\nArticle 19(2) so far as the attributes covered by Article 19(1) are\nconcerned. In other words, the State must satisfy that both the\nfundamental rights are not infringed by showing that there is a law\nand that it does amount to a reasonable restriction within the\nmeaning of Article 19(2) of the Constitution. But in this case no such\ndefence is available, as admittedly there is no such law. So the\npetitioner can legitimately plead that his fundamental rights both\nunder Article 19(1)(d) and Article 21 are infringed by the State.\u201d18\n17 Ibid, at page 351\n18 Ibid, at pages 356-357\n15\nPART C\n18 Justice Subba Rao held that Article 21 embodies the right of the individual to\nbe free from restrictions or encroachments. In this view, though the Constitution does\nnot expressly declare the right to privacy as a fundamental right, such a right is\nessential to personal liberty. The dissenting opinion places the matter of principle as\nfollows:\n\u201cIn an uncivilized society where there are no inhibitions, only\nphysical restraints may detract from personal liberty, but as\ncivilization advances the psychological restraints are more effective\nthan physical ones. The scientific methods used to condition a\nman's mind are in a real sense physical restraints, for they\nengender physical fear channelling one's actions through\nanticipated and expected grooves. So also the creation of\nconditions which necessarily engender inhibitions and fear\ncomplexes can be described as physical restraints. Further, the\nright to personal liberty takes in not only a right to be free from\nrestrictions placed on his movements, but also free from\nencroachments on his private life. It is true our Constitution does\nnot expressly declare a right to privacy as a fundamental right,\nbut the said right is an essential ingredient of personal liberty.\nEvery democratic country sanctifies domestic life; it is expected to\ngive him rest, physical happiness, peace of mind and security. In\nthe last resort, a person's house, where he lives with his family, is\nhis \u201ccastle\u201d; it is his rampart against encroachment on his personal\nliberty. The pregnant words of that famous Judge, Frankfurter\nJ., in Wolf v. Colorado [[1949] 238 US 25] pointing out the\nimportance of the security of one's privacy against arbitrary\nintrusion by the police, could have no less application to an\nIndian home as to an American one. If physical restraints on a\nperson's movements affect his personal liberty, physical\nencroachments on his private life would affect it in a larger degree.\nIndeed, nothing is more deleterious to a man's physical happiness\nand health than a calculated interference with his privacy. We\nwould, therefore, define the right of personal liberty in Article 21 as\na right of an individual to be free from restrictions or encroachments\non his person, whether those restrictions or encroachments are\ndirectly imposed or indirectly brought about by calculated\nmeasures. If so understood, all the acts of surveillance under\n16\nPART D\nRegulation 236 infringe the fundamental right of the petitioner under\nArticle 21 of the Constitution.\u201d19 (emphasis supplied)\nSignificantly, both Justice Rajagopala Ayyangar for the majority and Justice Subba\nRao in his dissent rely upon the observations of Justice Frankfurter in Wolf v\nColorado which specifically advert to privacy. The majority, while relying upon them\nto invalidate domiciliary visits at night, regards the sanctity of the home as part of\nordered liberty. In the context of other provisions of the regulation, the majority\ndeclines to recognise a right of privacy as a constitutional protection. Justice Subba\nRao recognised a constitutional by protected right to privacy, considering it as an\ningredient of personal liberty.\nD Gopalan doctrine : fundamental rights as isolated silos\n19 When eight judges of this Court rendered the decision in M P Sharma in 1954\nand later, six judges decided the controversy in Kharak Singh in 1962, the ascendant\nand, even well established, doctrine governing the fundamental rights contained in\nPart III was founded on the Gopalan principle. In Gopalan, Chief Justice Kania,\nspeaking for a majority of five of the Bench of six judges, construed the relationship\nbetween Articles 19 and 21 to be one of mutual exclusion. In this line of enquiry, what\nwas comprehended by Article 19 was excluded from Article 21. The seven freedoms\nof Article 19 were not subsumed in the fabric of life or personal liberty in Article 21.\n19 Ibid, at pages 358-359\n17\nPART D\nThe consequence was that a law which curtailed one of the freedoms guaranteed by\nArticle 19 would be required to answer the tests of reasonableness prescribed by\nclauses 2 to 6 of Article 19 and those alone. In the Gopalan perspective, free speech\nand expression was guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) and was hence excluded from\npersonal liberty under Article 21. Article 21 was but a residue. Chief Justice Kania\nheld :\n\u201cReading Article 19 in that way it appears to me that the concept of\nthe right to move freely throughout the territory of India is an entirely\ndifferent concept from the right to \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d contemplated\nby Article 21. \u201cPersonal liberty\u201d covers many more rights in one\nsense and has a restricted meaning in another sense. For instance,\nwhile the right to move or reside may be covered by the expression,\n\u201cpersonal liberty\u201d the right to freedom of speech (mentioned in\nArticle 19(1)(a)) or the right to acquire, hold or dispose of property\n(mentioned in 19(1)(f)) cannot be considered a part of\nthe personal liberty of a citizen. They form part of the liberty of a\ncitizen but the limitation imposed by the word \u201cpersonal\u201d leads me\nto believe that those rights are not covered by the expression\npersonal liberty. So read there is no conflict between Articles 19 and\n21. The contents and subject-matters of Articles 19 and 21 are thus\nnot the same and they proceed to deal with the rights covered by\ntheir respective words from totally different angles. As already\nmentioned in respect of each of the rights specified in sub-clauses\nof Article 19(1) specific limitations in respect of each is provided,\nwhile the expression \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d in Article 21 is generally\ncontrolled by the general expression \u201cprocedure established by\nlaw\u201d.\u201d20\n\u2018Procedure established by law\u2019 under Article 21 was, in this view, not capable of being\nexpanded to include the \u2018due process of law\u2019. Justice Fazl Ali dissented. The dissent\n20 Gopalan (Supra note 3), at pages 36-37\n18\nPART D\nadopted the view that the fundamental rights are not isolated and separate but protect\na common thread of liberty and freedom:\n\u201cTo my mind, the scheme of the Chapter dealing with the\nfundamental rights does not contemplate what is attributed to it,\nnamely, that each article is a code by itself and is independent of\nthe others. In my opinion, it cannot be said that Articles 19,20, 21\nand 22 do not to some extent overlap each other. The case of a\nperson who is convicted of an offence will come under Articles 20\nand 21 and also under Article 22 so far as his arrest and detention\nin custody before trial are concerned. Preventive detention, which\nis dealt with an Article 22, also amounts to deprivation of personal\nliberty which is referred to in Article 21, and is a violation of the right\nof freedom of movement dealt with in Article 19(1)(d)\u2026\nIt seems clear that the addition of the word \u201cpersonal\u201d before\n\u201cliberty\u201d in Article 21 cannot change the meaning of the words used\nin Article 19, nor can it put a matter which is inseparably bound up\nwith personal liberty beyond its place...\u201d21\n20 In Satwant Singh Sawhney v D Ramarathnam22 (\u201cSatwant Singh\nSawhney\u201d), Justice Hidayatullah, speaking for himself and Justice R S Bachawat, in\nthe dissenting view noticed the clear lines of distinction between the dissent of Justice\nSubba Rao and the view of the majority in Kharak Singh. The observations of Justice\nHidayatullah indicate that if the right of locomotion is embodied by Article 21 of which\none aspect is covered by Article 19(1)(d), that would in fact advance the minority view\nin Kharak Singh:\n\u201cSubba Rao J. (as he then was) read personal liberty as the\nantithesis of physical restraint or coercion and found that Articles\n19(1) and 21 overlapped and Article 19(1)(d) was not carved out of\npersonal liberty in Article 21. According to him, personal liberty\ncould be curtailed by law, but that law must satisfy the test in Article\n21 Ibid, at pages 52-53\n22 (1967) 3 SCR 525\n19\nPART E\n19(2) in so far as the specific rights in Article 19(1)(3) are\nconcerned. In other words, the State must satisfy that both the\nfundamental rights are not infringed by showing that there is a law\nand that it does not amount to an unreasonable restriction within\nthe meaning of Article 19(2) of the Constitution. As in that case\nthere was no law, fundamental rights, both under Article 19(1)(d)\nand Article 21 were held to be infringed. The learned Chief Justice\nhas read into the decision of the Court a meaning which it does not\nintend to convey. He excludes from Article 21 the right to free\nmotion and locomotion within the territories of India and puts the\nright to travel abroad in Article 21. He wants to see a law and if his\nearlier reasoning were to prevail, the law should stand the test of\nArticle 19(2). But since clause (2) deals with matters in Article 19(1)\nalready held excluded, it is obvious that it will not apply. The law\nwhich is made can only be tested on the ground of articles other\nthan Article 19 such as Articles 14, 20 and 22 which alone bears\nupon this matter. In other words, the majority decision of the Court\nin this case has rejected Ayyangar J.'s view and accepted the view\nof the minority in Kharak Singh case\u2026\nThis view obviously clashes with the reading of Article 21 in Kharak\nSingh case, because there the right of motion and locomotion was\nheld to be excluded from Article 21. In other words, the present\ndecision advances the minority view in Kharak Singh case above\nthe majority view stated in that case.\u201d23\nE Cooper and Maneka : Interrelationship between rights\n21 The theory that the fundamental rights are water-tight compartments was\ndiscarded in the judgment of eleven judges of this Court in Cooper. Gopalan had\nadopted the view that a law of preventive detention would be tested for its validity only\nwith reference to Article 22, which was a complete code relating to the subject.\nLegislation on preventive detention did not, in this view, have to meet the touchstone\nof Article 19(1)(d). The dissenting view of Justice Fazl Ali in Gopalan was noticed by\n23 Ibid, at page 554\n20\nPART E\nJustice J C Shah, speaking for this Court, in Cooper. The consequence of the\nGopalan doctrine was that the protection afforded by a guarantee of personal freedom\nwould be decided by the object of the State action in relation to the right of the\nindividual and not upon its effect upon the guarantee. Disagreeing with this view, the\nCourt in Cooper held thus :\n\u201d\u2026it is necessary to bear in mind the enunciation of the guarantee\nof fundamental rights which has taken different forms. In some\ncases it is an express declaration of a guaranteed right: Articles\n29(1), 30(1), 26, 25 and 32; in others to ensure protection of\nindividual rights they take specific forms of restrictions on State\naction \u2014 legislative or executive \u2014 Articles 14, 15, 16, 20, 21,\n22(1), 27 and 28; in some others, it takes the form of a positive\ndeclaration and simultaneously enunciates the restriction thereon:\nArticles 19(1) and 19(2) to (6); in some cases, it arises as an\nimplication from the delimitation of the authority of the State, e.g.\nArticles 31(1) and 31(2); in still others, it takes the form of a general\nprohibition against the State as well as others: Articles 17, 23 and\n24. The enunciation of rights either express or by implication\ndoes not follow a uniform pattern. But one thread runs through\nthem: they seek to protect the rights of the individual or groups\nof individuals against infringement of those rights within\nspecific limits. Part III of the Constitution weaves a pattern of\nguarantees on the texture of basic human rights. The\nguarantees delimit the protection of those rights in their\nallotted fields: they do not attempt to enunciate distinct\nrights.\u201d24 (emphasis supplied)\n22 The abrogation of the Gopalan doctrine in Cooper was revisited in a seven-\njudge Bench decision in Maneka. Justice P N Bhagwati who delivered the leading\nopinion of three Judges held that the judgment in Cooper affirms the dissenting\n24 Cooper (Supra note 4), at page 289 (para 52)\n21\nPART E\nopinion of Justice Subba Rao (in Kharak Singh) as expressing the valid constitutional\nposition. Hence in Maneka, the Court held that:\n\u201cIt was in Kharak Singh v. State of U.P.[AIR 1963 SC 1295 : (1964)\n1 SCR 332 : (1963) 2 Cri LJ 329] that the question as to the proper\nscope and meaning of the expression \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d came up\npointedly for consideration for the first time before this Court. The\nmajority of the Judges took the view \u201cthat \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d is used\nin the article as a compendious term to include within itself all the\nvarieties of rights which go to make up the \u201cpersonal liberties\u201d of\nman other than those dealt with in the several clauses of Article\n19(1). In other words, while Article 19(1) deals with particular\nspecies or attributes of that freedom, \u2018personal liberty\u2019 in Article 21\ntakes in and comprises the residue. The minority Judges, however,\ndisagreed with this view taken by the majority and explained their\nposition in the following words: \u201cNo doubt the expression \u2018personal\nliberty\u2019 is a comprehensive one and the right to move freely is an\nattribute of personal liberty. It is said that the freedom to move freely\nis carved out of personal liberty and, therefore, the expression\n\u2018personal liberty\u2019 in Article 21 excludes that attribute. In our view,\nthis is not a correct approach. Both are independent fundamental\nrights, though there is overlapping. There is no question of one\nbeing carved out of another. The fundamental right of life and\npersonal liberty has many attributes and some of them are found in\nArticle 19. If a person's fundamental right under Article 21 is\ninfringed, the State can rely upon a law to sustain the action, but\nthat cannot be a complete answer unless the said law satisfies the\ntest laid down in Article 19(2) so far as the attributes covered by\nArticle 19(1) are concerned.\u201d There can be no doubt that in view\nof the decision of this Court in R.C. Cooper v. Union of\nIndia [(1970) 2 SCC 298 : (1971) 1 SCR 512] the minority view\nmust be regarded as correct and the majority view must be\nheld to have been overruled.\u201d25 (emphasis supplied)\n23 Following the decision in Maneka, the established constitutional doctrine is that\nthe expression \u2018personal liberty\u2019 in Article 21 covers a variety of rights, some of which\n25 Maneka (Supra Note 5), at page 278 (para 5)\n22\nPART E\n\u2018have been raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights\u2019 and given additional\nprotection under Article 19. Consequently, in Satwant Singh Sawhney, the right to\ntravel abroad was held to be subsumed within Article 21 as a consequence of which\nany deprivation of that right could be only by a \u2018procedure established by law\u2019. Prior\nto the enactment of the Passports Act, 1967, there was no law regulating the right to\ntravel abroad as a result of which the order of the Passport Officer refusing a passport\nwas held to be invalid. The decision in Maneka carried the constitutional principle of\nthe over-lapping nature of fundamental rights to its logical conclusion.\nReasonableness which is the foundation of the guarantee against arbitrary state\naction under Article 14 infuses Article 21. A law which provides for a deprivation of life\nor personal liberty under Article 21 must lay down not just any procedure but a\nprocedure which is fair, just and reasonable.\n24 The decisions in M P Sharma and Kharak Singh adopted a doctrinal position\non the relationship between Articles 19 and 21, based on the view of the majority in\nGopalan. This view stands abrogated particularly by the judgment in Cooper and the\nsubsequent statement of doctrine in Maneka. The decision in Maneka, in fact,\nexpressly recognized that it is the dissenting judgment of Justice Subba Rao in\nKharak Singh which represents the exposition of the correct constitutional principle.\nThe jurisprudential foundation which held the field sixty three years ago in M P\nSharma and fifty five years ago in Kharak Singh has given way to what is now a\nsettled position in constitutional law. Firstly, the fundamental rights emanate from\nbasic notions of liberty and dignity and the enumeration of some facets of liberty as\n23\nPART E\ndistinctly protected rights under Article 19 does not denude Article 21 of its expansive\nambit. Secondly, the validity of a law which infringes the fundamental rights has to be\ntested not with reference to the object of state action but on the basis of its effect on\nthe guarantees of freedom. Thirdly, the requirement of Article 14 that state action\nmust not be arbitrary and must fulfil the requirement of reasonableness, imparts\nmeaning to the constitutional guarantees in Part III.\n25 The doctrinal invalidation of the basic premise underlying the decisions in M P\nSharma and Kharak Singh still leaves the issue of whether privacy is a right protected\nby Part III of the Constitution open for consideration. There are observations in both\ndecisions that the Constitution does not contain a specific protection of the right to\nprivacy. Presently, the matter can be looked at from the perspective of what actually\nwas the controversy in the two cases. M P Sharma was a case where a law\nprescribing a search to obtain documents for investigating into offences was\nchallenged as being contrary to the guarantee against self-incrimination in Article\n20(3). The Court repelled the argument that a search for documents compelled a\nperson accused of an offence to be witness against himself. Unlike a notice to produce\ndocuments, which is addressed to a person and whose compliance would constitute\na testimonial act, a search warrant and a seizure which follows are not testimonial\nacts of a person to whom the warrant is addressed, within the meaning of Article 20(3).\nThe Court having held this, the controversy in M P Sharma would rest at that. The\nobservations in M P Sharma to the effect that the constitution makers had not thought\nit fit to subject the regulatory power of search and seizure to constitutional limitations\n24\nPART E\nby recognising a fundamental right of privacy (like the US Fourth amendment), and\nthat there was no justification to impart it into a \u2018totally different fundamental right\u2019 are\nat the highest, stray observations.\n26 The decision in M P Sharma held that in the absence of a provision like the\nFourth Amendment to the US Constitution, a right to privacy cannot be read into the\nIndian Constitution. The decision in M P Sharma did not decide whether a\nconstitutional right to privacy is protected by other provisions contained in the\nfundamental rights including among them, the right to life and personal liberty under\nArticle 21. Hence the decision cannot be construed to specifically exclude the\nprotection of privacy under the framework of protected guarantees including those in\nArticles 19 or 21. The absence of an express constitutional guarantee of privacy still\nbegs the question whether privacy is an element of liberty and, as an integral part of\nhuman dignity, is comprehended within the protection of life as well.\n27 The decision in Kharak Singh is noteworthy because while invalidating\nRegulation 236(b) of the Police Regulations which provided for nightly domiciliary\nvisits, the majority construed this to be an unauthorized intrusion into a person\u2019s home\nand a violation of ordered liberty. While arriving at this conclusion, the majority\nplaced reliance on the privacy doctrine enunciated by Justice Frankfurter, speaking\nfor the US Supreme Court in Wolf v Colorado (the extract from Wolf cited in the\nmajority judgment specifically adverts to \u2018privacy\u2019 twice). Having relied on this doctrine\n25\nPART F\nto invalidate domiciliary visits, the majority in Kharak Singh proceeded to repel the\nchallenge to other clauses of Regulation 236 on the ground that the right of privacy is\nnot guaranteed under the Constitution and hence Article 21 had no application. This\npart of the judgment in Kharak Singh is inconsistent with the earlier part of the\ndecision. The decision of the majority in Kharak Singh suffers from an internal\ninconsistency.\nF Origins of privacy\n28 An evaluation of the origins of privacy is essential in order to understand\nwhether (as the Union of India postulates), the concept is so amorphous as to defy\ndescription. The submission of the government is that the Court cannot recognize a\njuristic concept which is so vague and uncertain that it fails to withstand constitutional\nscrutiny. This makes it necessary to analyse the origins of privacy and to trace its\nevolution.\n29 The Greek philosopher Aristotle spoke of a division between the public sphere\nof political affairs (which he termed the polis) and the personal sphere of human life\n(termed oikos). This dichotomy may provide an early recognition of \u201ca confidential\nzone on behalf of the citizen\u201d26. Aristotle\u2019s distinction between the public and private\nrealms can be regarded as providing a basis for restricting governmental authority to\nactivities falling within the public realm. On the other hand, activities in the private\n26 Michael C. James, \u201cA Comparative Analysis of the Right to Privacy in the United States, Canada and Europe\u201d,\nConnecticut Journal of International Law (Spring 2014), Vol. 29, Issue 2, at page 261\n26\nPART F\nrealm are more appropriately reserved for \u201cprivate reflection, familial relations and\nself-determination\u201d27.\n30 At a certain level, the evolution of the doctrine of privacy has followed the public\n\u2013 private distinction. William Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland (1765) spoke about this distinction while dividing wrongs into private wrongs\nand public wrongs. Private wrongs are an infringement merely of particular rights\nconcerning individuals and are in the nature of civil injuries. Public wrongs constitute\na breach of general and public rights affecting the whole community and according to\nhim, are called crimes and misdemeanours.\n31 John Stuart Mill in his essay, \u2018On Liberty\u2019 (1859) gave expression to the need\nto preserve a zone within which the liberty of the citizen would be free from the\nauthority of the state. According to Mill :\n\u201cThe only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable\nto society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely\nconcerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over\nhimself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\u201d28\nWhile speaking of a \u201cstruggle between liberty and authority\u201d29, Mill posited that the\ntyranny of the majority could be reined by the recognition of civil rights such as the\nindividual right to privacy, free speech, assembly and expression.\n27 Ibid, at page 262\n28 John Stuart Mill, On Liberty, Batoche Books (1859), at page 13\n29 Ibid, at page 6\n27\nPART F\n32 Austin in his Lectures on Jurisprudence (1869) spoke of the distinction\nbetween the public and the private realms : jus publicum and jus privatum.\nThe distinction between the public and private realms has its limitations. If the reason\nfor protecting privacy is the dignity of the individual, the rationale for its existence does\nnot cease merely because the individual has to interact with others in the public arena.\nThe extent to which an individual expects privacy in a public street may be different\nfrom that which she expects in the sanctity of the home. Yet if dignity is the underlying\nfeature, the basis of recognising the right to privacy is not denuded in public spaces.\nThe extent of permissible state regulation may, however, differ based on the legitimate\nconcerns of governmental authority.\n33 James Madison, who was the architect of the American Constitution,\ncontemplated the protection of the faculties of the citizen as an incident of the\ninalienable property rights of human beings. In his words :\n\u201cIn the former sense, a man\u2019s land, or merchandize, or money is\ncalled his property. In the latter sense, a man has property in his\nopinions and the free communication of them\u2026\nHe has an equal property interest in the free use of his faculties and\nfree choice of the objects on which to employ them. In a word, as a\nman is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said\nto have a property in his rights. Where an excess of power prevails,\nproperty of no sort is duly respected. No man is safe in his opinions,\nhis person, his faculties or his possessions\u2026\nConscience is the most sacred of all property; other property\ndepending in part on positive law, the exercise of that, being a\nnatural and inalienable right. To guard a man\u2019s house as his castle,\n28\nPART F\nto pay public and enforce private debts with the most exact faith,\ncan give no title to invade a man\u2019s conscience which is more sacred\nthan his castle, or to withhold from it that debt of protection, for\nwhich the public faith is pledged, by the very nature and original\nconditions of the social pact.\u201d30\nMadison traced the recognition of an inviolable zone to an inalienable right to property.\nProperty is construed in the broadest sense to include tangibles and intangibles and\nultimately to control over one\u2019s conscience itself.\n34 In an article published on 15 December 1890 in the Harvard Law Review,\nSamuel D Warren and Louis Brandeis adverted to the evolution of the law to\nincorporate within it, the right to life as \u201ca recognition of man\u2019s spiritual nature, of his\nfeelings and his intellect\u201d31. As legal rights were broadened, the right to life had \u201ccome\nto mean the right to enjoy life \u2013 the right to be let alone\u201d. Recognizing that \u201conly a\npart of the pain, pleasure and profit of life lay in physical things\u201d and that \u201cthoughts,\nemotions, and sensations demanded legal recognition\u201d, Warren and Brandeis\nrevealed with a sense of perspicacity the impact of technology on the right to be let\nalone:\n\u201cRecent inventions and business methods call attention to the next\nstep which must be taken for the protection of the person, and for\nsecuring to the individual what Judge Cooley calls the right \u201cto be\nlet alone\u201d. Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise\nhave invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life; and\nnumerous mechanical devices threaten to make good the\nprediction that \u201cwhat is whispered in the closet shall be proclaimed\n30 James Madison, \u201cEssay on Property\u201d, in Gaillard Hunt ed., The Writings of James Madison (1906), Vol. 6, at\npages 101-103.\n31 Warren and Brandeis, \u201cThe Right to Privacy\u201d, Harvard Law Review (1890), Vol.4, No. 5, at page 193\n29\nPART F\nfrom the house-tops.\u201d For years there has been a feeling that the\nlaw must afford some remedy for the unauthorized circulation of\nportraits of private persons\u2026\nThe intensity and complexity of life, attendant upon advancing\ncivilization, have rendered necessary some retreat from the world,\nand man, under the refining influence of culture, has become more\nsensitive to publicity, so that solitude and privacy have become\nmore essential to the individual; but modern enterprise and\ninvention have, through invasions upon his privacy, subjected him\nto mental pain and distress, far greater than could be inflicted by\nmere bodily injury.\u201d32\nIn their seminal article, Warren and Brandeis observed that:\n\u201cThe principle which protects personal writings and all other\npersonal productions, not against theft and physical appropriation,\nbut against publication in any form, is in reality not the principle of\nprivate property, but that of an inviolate personality.\u201d33\n(emphasis supplied)\nThe right \u201cto be let alone\u201d thus represented a manifestation of \u201can inviolate\npersonality\u201d, a core of freedom and liberty from which the human being had to be free\nfrom intrusion. The technology which provided a justification for the need to preserve\nthe privacy of the individual was the development of photography. The right to be let\nalone was not so much an incident of property as a reflection of the inviolable nature\nof the human personality.\n35 The ringing observations of Warren and Brandeis on the impact of technology\nhave continued relevance today in a globalized world dominated by the internet and\n32 Ibid, at pages 195-196\n33 Ibid, at page 205\n30\nPART F\ninformation technology. As societies have evolved, so have the connotations and\nambit of privacy.\n36 Though many contemporary accounts attribute the modern conception of the\n\u2018right to privacy\u2019 to the Warren and Brandeis article, historical material indicates that it\nwas Thomas Cooley who adopted the phrase \u201cthe right to be let alone\u201d, in his\nTreatise on the Law of Torts34. Discussing personal immunity, Cooley stated:\n\u201cthe right of one\u2019s person may be said to be a right of complete\nimmunity; the right to be alone.\u201d35\nRoscoe Pound described the Warren and Brandeis article as having done \u201cnothing\nless than add a chapter to our law\u201d36. However, another writer on the subject states\nthat:\n\u201cThis right to privacy was not new. Warren and Brandeis did not\neven coin the phrase, \u201cright to privacy,\u201d nor its common soubriquet,\n\u201cthe right to be let alone\u201d.\u201d37\nThe right to be let alone is a part of the right to enjoy life. The right to enjoy life is, in\nits turn, a part of the fundamental right to life of the individual.\n34 Thomas Cooley, Treatise on the Law of Torts (1888), 2nd edition\n35 Ibid, at page 29\n36 Dorothy J Glancy, \u201cThe Invention of the Right to Privacy\u201d, Arizona Law Review (1979) Vol. 21, No.1, at page 1.\nThe article attributes the Roscoe Pound quotation to \u201cLetter from Roscoe Pound to William Chilton (1916)\u201d as\nquoted in Alpheus Mason, Brandeis : A Free Man\u2019s Life 70 (1956).\n37 Ibid, at pages 2-3.\n31\nPART F\n37 The right to privacy was developed by Warren and Brandeis in the backdrop of\nthe dense urbanization which occurred particularly in the East Coast of the United\nStates. Between 1790 and 1890, the US population had risen from four million to sixty-\nthree million. The population of urban areas had grown over a hundred-fold since the\nend of the civil war. In 1890, over eight million people had immigrated to the US.\nTechnological progress and rapid innovations had led to the private realm being\nplaced under stress :\n\u201c\u2026technological progress during the post-Civil War decades had\nbrought to Boston and the rest of the United States \u201ccountless, little-\nnoticed revolutions\u201d in the form of a variety of inventions which\nmade the personal lives and personalities of individuals\nincreasingly accessible to large numbers of others, irrespective of\nacquaintance, social or economic class, or the customary\nconstraints of propriety. Bell invented the telephone in Boston; the\nfirst commercial telephone exchange opened there in 1877, while\nWarren and Brandeis were students at the Harvard Law School. By\n1890 there were also telegraphs, fairly inexpensive portable\ncameras, sound recording devices, and better and cheaper\nmethods of making window glass. Warren and Brandeis recognized\nthat these advances in technology, coupled with intensified\nnewspaper enterprise, increased the vulnerability of individuals to\nhaving their actions, words, images, and personalities\ncommunicated without their consent beyond the protected circle of\nfamily and chosen friends.\u201d38\nCoupled with this was the trend towards \u2018newspaperization\u201939, the increasing presence\nof the print media in American society. Six months before the publication of the Warren\nand Brandeis\u2019 article, E L Godkin, a newspaper man had published an article on the\nsame subject in Scribner\u2019s magazine in July 1890. Godkin, however, suggested no\n38 Ibid, at pages 7-8\n39 Ibid, at page 8\n32\nPART F\nrealistic remedy for protecting privacy against intrusion, save and except \u201cby the\ncudgel or the horsewhip\u201d40. It was Warren and Brandeis who advocated the use of the\ncommon law to vindicate the right to privacy.41\n38 Criminal libel actions were resorted to in the US during a part of the nineteenth\ncentury but by 1890, they had virtually ceased to be \u201ca viable protection for individual\nprivacy\u201d42. The Sedition Act of 1789 expired in 1801. Before truth came to be accepted\nas a defence in defamation actions, criminal libel prosecutions flourished in the State\ncourts.43 Similarly, truth was not regarded as a valid defence to a civil libel action in\nmuch of the nineteenth century. By the time Warren and Brandeis wrote their article\nin 1890, publication of the truth was perhaps no longer actionable under the law of\ndefamation. It was this breach or lacuna that they sought to fill up by speaking of the\nright to privacy which would protect the control of the individual over her personality.44\nThe right to privacy evolved as a \u201cleitmotif\u201d representing \u201cthe long tradition of American\nindividualism\u201d.45\n39 Conscious as we are of the limitations with which comparative frameworks46 of\nlaw and history should be evaluated, the above account is of significance.

See Ashna Ashesh and Bhairav Acharya ,\u201cLocating Constructs of Privacy\n33\nPART G\nthe basic need of every individual to live with dignity. Urbanization and economic\ndevelopment lead to a replacement of traditional social structures. Urban ghettos\nreplace the tranquillity of self-sufficient rural livelihoods. The need to protect the\nprivacy of the being is no less when development and technological change\ncontinuously threaten to place the person into public gaze and portend to submerge\nthe individual into a seamless web of inter-connected lives.\nG Natural and inalienable rights\n40 Privacy is a concomitant of the right of the individual to exercise control over\nhis or her personality. It finds an origin in the notion that there are certain rights which\nare natural to or inherent in a human being. Natural rights are inalienable because\nthey are inseparable from the human personality. The human element in life is\nimpossible to conceive without the existence of natural rights. In 1690, John Locke\nhad in his Second Treatise of Government observed that the lives, liberties and\nestates of individuals are as a matter of fundamental natural law, a private preserve.\nThe idea of a private preserve was to create barriers from outside interference. In\n1765, William Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of England spoke of\na \u201cnatural liberty\u201d. There were, in his view, absolute rights which were vested in the\nindividual by the immutable laws of nature. These absolute rights were divided into\nwithin Classical Hindu Law\u201d, The Centre for Internet and Society, available at https://cis-india.org/internet-\ngovernance/blog/loading-constructs-of-privacy-within-classical-hindu-law.

The right of personal security\ninvolved a legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of life, limbs, body, health and reputation\nby an individual.\n41 The notion that certain rights are inalienable was embodied in the American\nDeclaration of Independence (1776) in the following terms:\n\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created\nequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain\nunalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the\npursuit of happiness\u201d. (emphasis supplied)\nThe term inalienable rights was incorporated in the Declaration of the Rights of Man\nand of the Citizen (1789) adopted by the French National Assembly in the following\nterms:\n\u201cFor its drafters, to ignore, to forget or to depreciate the rights of\nman are the sole causes of public misfortune and government\ncorruption. These rights are natural rights, inalienable and\nsacred, the National Assembly recognizes and proclaims them-it\ndoes not grant, concede or establish them-and their conservation is\nthe reason for all political communities; within these rights figures\nresistance to oppression\u201d. (emphasis supplied)\n42 In 1921, Roscoe Pound, in his work titled \u201cThe Spirit of the Common Law\u201d,\nexplained the meaning of natural rights:\n\u201cNatural rights mean simply interests which we think ought to be\nsecured; demands which human beings may make which we think\nought to be satisfied. It is perfectly true that neither law nor state\n35\nPART G\ncreates them. But it is fatal to all sound thinking to treat them as\nlegal conceptions. For legal rights, the devices which law employs\nto secure such of these interests as it is expedient to recognize, are\nthe work of the law and in that sense the work of the state.\u201d47\nTwo decades later in 1942, Pound in \u201cThe Revival of Natural Law\u201d propounded\nthat:\n\u201cClassical natural law in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\nhad three postulates. One was natural rights, qualities of the ideal\nor perfect man in a state of perfection by virtue of which he ought\nto have certain things or be able to do certain things. These were\na guarantee of stability because the natural rights were taken\nto be immutable and inalienable. (2) The social compact, a\npostulated contract basis of civil society. Here was a guide to\nchange. (3) An ideal law of which positive laws were only\ndeclaratory; an ideal body of perfect precepts governing human\nrelations and ordering human conduct, guaranteeing the natural\nrights and expressing the social compact.\u201d48 (emphasis supplied)\n43 In 1955, Edwin W Patterson in \u201cA Pragmatist Looks At Natural Law and\nNatural Rights\u201d observed that rights which individuals while making a social compact\nto create a government, reserve to themselves, are natural rights because they\noriginate in a condition of nature and survive the social compact. In his words:\n\u201cThe basic rights of the citizen in our political society are regarded\nas continuing from a prepolitical condition or as arising in society\nindependently of positive constitutions, statutes, and judicial\ndecisions, which merely seek to \u201csecure\u201d or \u201csafeguard\u201d rights\nalready reserved. These rights are not granted by a benevolent\ndespot to his grateful subjects. The \u201cnatural rights\u201d theory thus\nprovided a convenient ideology for the preservation of such\nimportant rights as freedom of speech, freedom of religion and\nprocedural due process of law. As a pragmatist, I should prefer to\n47 Roscoe Pound, The Spirit of the Common Law, Marshall Jones Company (1921), at page 92\n48 Roscoe Pound, \u201cThe Revival of Natural Law\u201d, Notre Damne Lawyer (1942), Vol. 27, No 4, at page 330\n36\nPART G\nexplain them as individual and social interests which arise or exist\nnormally in our culture and are tuned into legal rights by being\nlegally protected.\u201d 49\n44 Natural rights are not bestowed by the state. They inhere in human beings\nbecause they are human. They exist equally in the individual irrespective of class or\nstrata, gender or orientation.\n45 Distinguishing an inalienable right to an object from the object itself\nemphasises the notion of inalienability. All human beings retain their inalienable rights\n(whatever their situation, whatever their acts, whatever their guilt or innocence). The\nconcept of natural inalienable rights secures autonomy to human beings. But the\nautonomy is not absolute, for the simple reason that, the concept of inalienable rights\npostulates that there are some rights which no human being may alienate. While\nnatural rights protect the right of the individual to choose and preserve liberty, yet the\nautonomy of the individual is not absolute or total. As a theoretical construct, it would\notherwise be strictly possible to hire another person to kill oneself or to sell oneself\ninto slavery or servitude. Though these acts are autonomous, they would be in\nviolation of inalienable rights. This is for the reason that:\n\u201c\u2026These acts, however autonomous, would be in violation of\ninalienable rights, as the theories would have it. They would be\nmorally invalid, and ineffective actually to alienate inalienable rights.\nAlthough self-regarding, they pretend to an autonomy that does not\nexist. Inalienable rights are precisely directed against such false\n49 Edwin W. Patterson, \u201cA Pragmatist Looks At Natural Law and Natural Rights\u201d, in Arthur L. Harding ed., Natural\nLaw and Natural Rights (1955), at pages 62-63\n37\nPART G\nautonomy.\nNatural inalienable rights, like other natural rights, have long rested\nupon what has been called the law of nature of natural law. Perhaps\nall of the theories discussed above could be called law of nature or\nnatural law theories. The American tradition, even as early as 1641,\nten years before Thomas Hobbes published Leviathan, included\nclaims of natural rights, and these claims appealed to the law of\nnature, often in terms. Without a moral order of the law of nature\nsort, natural inalienable rights are difficult to pose. \u201c\u2019It is from natural\nlaw, and from it alone, that man obtains those rights we refer to as\ninalienable and inviolable\u2026Human rights can have no foundation\nother than natural law.\u201d50\n46 The idea that individuals can have rights against the State that are prior to rights\ncreated by explicit legislation has been developed as part of a liberal theory of law\npropounded by Ronald Dworkin. In his seminal work titled \u201cTaking Rights\nSeriously\u201d51 (1977), he states that:\n\u201cIndividual rights are political trumps held by individuals.\nIndividuals have rights when, for some reason, a collective goal is\nnot a sufficient justification for denying them what they wish, as\nindividuals, to have or to do, or not a sufficient justification for\nimposing some loss or injury upon them.\u201d52 (emphasis supplied)\nDworkin asserts the existence of a right against the government as essential to\nprotecting the dignity of the individual:\n\u201cIt makes sense to say that a man has a fundamental right\nagainst the Government, in the strong sense, like free speech,\nif that right is necessary to protect his dignity, or his standing\n50 Craig A.

He\nstates:\n\u201cIndeed, the suggestion that rights can be demonstrated by a\nprocess of history rather than by an appeal to principle shows either\na confusion or no real concern about what rights are\u2026\nThis has been a complex argument, and I want to summarize it. Our\nconstitutional system rests on a particular moral theory, namely,\nthat men have moral rights against the state. The different clauses\nof the Bill of Rights, like the due process and equal protection\nclauses, must be understood as appealing to moral concepts rather\nthan laying down particular concepts; therefore, a court that\nundertakes the burden of applying these clauses fully as law must\n53 Ibid, at page 199\n54 Ibid, at page 203\n55 Ibid, at page 204\n56 Ibid, at page 205\n39\nPART H\nbe an activist court, in the sense that it must be prepared to frame\nand answer questions of political morality\u2026\u201d57\nA later section of this judgment deals with how natural and inalienable rights have\nbeen developed in Indian precedent.\nH Evolution of the privacy doctrine in India\n47 Among the early decisions of this Court following Kharak Singh was R M\nMalkani v State of Maharashtra58. In that case, this Court held that Section 25 of\nthe Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 was not violated because :\n\u201cWhere a person talking on the telephone allows another person to\nrecord it or to hear it, it cannot be said that the other person who is\nallowed to do so is damaging, removing, tampering, touching\nmachinery battery line or post for intercepting or acquainting himself\nwith the contents of any message. There was no element of\ncoercion or compulsion in attaching the tape recorder to the\ntelephone.\u201d59\nThis Court followed the same line of reasoning as it had in Kharak Singh while\nrejecting a privacy based challenge under Article 21. Significantly, the Court observed\nthat :\n\u201cArticle 21 was invoked by submitting that the privacy of the\nappellant\u2019s conversation was invaded. Article 21 contemplates\nprocedure established by law with regard to deprivation of life or\npersonal liberty. The telephone conversation of an innocent citizen\nwill be protected by Courts against wrongful or high handed\ninterference by tapping the conversation. The protection is not for\n57 Ibid, at page 147\n58 (1973) 1 SCC 471\n59 Ibid, at page 476 (para 20)\n40\nPART H\nthe guilty citizen against the efforts of the police to vindicate the law\nand prevent corruption of public servants. It must not be understood\nthat the Court will tolerate safeguards for the protection of the\ncitizen to be imperilled by permitting the police to proceed by\nunlawful or irregular methods.\u201d60\nIn other words, it was the targeted and specific nature of the interception which\nweighed with the Court, the telephone tapping being directed at a guilty person. Hence\nthe Court ruled that the telephone conversation of an innocent citizen will be protected\nagainst wrongful interference by wiretapping.\n48 In Gobind61, a Bench of three judges of this Court considered a challenge to\nthe validity of Regulations 855 and 856 of State Police Regulations under which a\nhistory sheet was opened against the petitioner who had been placed under\nsurveillance. The Bench of three judges adverted to the decision in Kharak Singh\nand to the validation of the Police Regulations (other than domiciliary visits at night).\nBy the time the decision was handed down in Gobind, the law in the US had evolved\nand this Court took note of the decision in Griswold v Connecticut62 (\u201cGriswold\u201d) in\nwhich a conviction under a statute on a charge of giving information and advice to\nmarried persons on contraceptive methods was held to be invalid. This Court adverted\nto the dictum that specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights have penumbras which\ncreate zones of privacy. The Court also relied upon the US Supreme Court decision\nin Jane Roe v Henry Wade63 in which the Court upheld the right of a married woman\n60 Ibid, at page 479 (para 31)\n61 (1975) 2 SCC 148\n62 381 US 479 (1965)\n63 410 US 113 (1973)\n41\nPART H\nto terminate her pregnancy as a part of the right of personal privacy. The following\nobservations of Justice Mathew, who delivered the judgment of the Court do indicate\na constitutional recognition of the right to be let alone :\n\u201cThere can be no doubt that the makers of our Constitution wanted\nto ensure conditions favourable to the pursuit of happiness. They\ncertainly realized as Brandeis, J. said in his dissent in Olmstead v.\nUnited States64, the significance of man\u2019s spiritual nature, of his\nfeelings and of his intellect and that only a part of the pain, pleasure,\nsatisfaction of life can be found in material things and therefore,\nthey must be deemed to have conferred upon the individual as\nagainst the government a sphere where he should be let alone\u201d.65\nThese observations follow upon a reference to the Warren and Brandeis article; the\ntwo decisions of the US Supreme Court noted earlier; the writings of Locke and Kant;\nand to dignity, liberty and autonomy.\n49 Yet a close reading of the decision in Gobind would indicate that the Court\neventually did not enter a specific finding on the existence of a right to privacy under\nthe Constitution. The Court indicated that if the Court does find that a particular right\nshould be protected as a fundamental privacy right, it could be overridden only subject\nto a compelling interest of the State :\n\u201cThere can be no doubt that privacy-dignity claims deserve to be\nexamined with care and to be denied only when an important\ncountervailing interest is shown to be superior. If the Court does\nfind that a claimed right is entitled to protection as a\nfundamental privacy right, a law infringing it must satisfy the\ncompelling State interest test. Then the question would be\n64 277 US 438 (1928)\n65 Supra note 6, at page 155 (para 20)\n42\nPART H\nwhether a State interest is of such paramount importance as would\njustify an infringement of the right.\u201d66 (emphasis supplied)\nWhile emphasising individual autonomy and the dangers of individual privacy being\neroded by new developments that \u201cwill make it possible to be heard in the street what\nis whispered in the closet\u201d, the Court had obvious concerns about adopting a broad\ndefinition of privacy since the right of privacy \u201cis not explicit in the Constitution\u201d.\nObserving that the concept of privacy overlaps with liberty, this Court noted thus :\n\u201cIndividual autonomy, perhaps the central concern of any system of\nlimited government, is protected in part under our Constitution by\nexplicit constitutional guarantees. In the application of the\nConstitution our contemplation cannot only be of what has been but\nwhat may be. Time works changes and brings into existence\nnew conditions. Subtler and far reaching means of invading\nprivacy will make it possible to be heard in the street what is\nwhispered in the closet. Yet, too broad a definition of privacy\nraises serious questions about the propriety of judicial\nreliance on a right that is not explicit in the Constitution. Of\ncourse, privacy primarily concerns the individual. It therefore\nrelates to and overlaps with the concept of liberty. The most serious\nadvocate of privacy must confess that there are serious problems\nof defining the essence and scope of the right. Privacy interest in\nautonomy must also be placed in the context of other rights and\nvalues.\u201d67 (emphasis supplied)\nJustice Mathew proceeded to explain what any right of privacy must encompass and\nprotect and found it to be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty :\n\u201cAny right to privacy must encompass and protect the personal\nintimacies of the home, the family, marriage, motherhood,\nprocreation and child rearing. This catalogue approach to the\nquestion is obviously not as instructive as it does not give an\nanalytical picture of the distinctive characteristics of the right of\n66 Ibid, at page 155 (para 22)\n67 Ibid, at page 156 (para 23)\n43\nPART H\nprivacy. Perhaps, the only suggestion that can be offered as\nunifying principle underlying the concept has been the assertion\nthat a claimed right must be a fundamental right implicit in the\nconcept of ordered liberty.\u201d68\nIn adverting to ordered liberty, the judgment is similar to the statement in the judgment\nof Justice Rajagopala Ayyangar in Kharak Singh which found the intrusion of the\nhome by nightly domiciliary visits a violation of ordered liberty.\nThe Court proceeded to hold that in any event, the right to privacy will need a case to\ncase elaboration. The following observations were carefully crafted to hold that even\non the \u201cassumption\u201d that there is an independent right of privacy emanating from\npersonal liberty, the right to movement and free speech, the right is not absolute:\n\u201cThe right to privacy in any event will necessarily have to go through\na process of case-by-case development. Therefore, even\nassuming that the right to personal liberty, the right to move\nfreely throughout the territory of India and the freedom of\nspeech create an independent right of privacy as an emanation\nfrom them which one can characterize as a fundamental right, we\ndo not think that the right is absolute.\u201d69\n(emphasis supplied)\nAgain a similar \u201cassumption\u201d was made by the Court in the following observations:\n\u201c\u2026Assuming that the fundamental rights explicitly guaranteed to a\ncitizen have penumbral zones and that the right to privacy is itself a\nfundamental right, that fundamental right must be subject to\nrestriction on the basis of compelling public interest. As Regulation\n856 has the force of law, it cannot be said that the fundamental right\nof the petitioner under Article 21 has been violated by the provisions\n68 Ibid, at page 156 (para 24)\n69 Ibid, at page 157 (para 28)\n44\nPART H\ncontained in it : for, what is guaranteed under that Article is that no\nperson shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except by the\nprocedure established by \u2018law\u2019. We think that the procedure is\nreasonable having regard to the provisions of Regulations 853 (c)\nand 857.\u201d70 (emphasis supplied)\nThe Court declined to interfere with the regulations.\n50 The judgment in Gobind does not contain a clear statement of principle by the\nCourt of the existence of an independent right of privacy or of such a right being an\nemanation from explicit constitutional guarantees. The Bench, which consisted of\nthree judges, may have been constrained by the dictum in the latter part of Kharak\nSingh. Whatever be the reason, it is evident that in several places Justice Mathew\nproceeded on the \u201cassumption\u201d that if the right to privacy is protected under the\nConstitution, it is a part of ordered liberty and is not absolute but subject to restrictions\ntailor-made to fulfil a compelling state interest. This analysis of the decision in Gobind\nassumes significance because subsequent decisions of smaller Benches have\nproceeded on the basis that Gobind does indeed recognise a right to privacy. What\nthe contours of such a right are, emerges from a reading of those decisions. This is\nthe next aspect to which we now turn.\n51 Malak Singh v State of Punjab and Haryana71 (\u201cMalak Singh\u201d) dealt with the\nprovisions of Section 23 of the Punjab Police Rules under which a surveillance register\n70 Ibid, at page 157-158 (para 31)\n71 (1981) 1 SCC 420\n45\nPART H\nwas to be maintained among other persons, of all convicts of a particular description\nand persons who were reasonably believed to be habitual offenders whether or not,\nthey were convicted. The validity of the rules was not questioned in view of the\ndecisions in Kharak Singh and Gobind. The rules provided for modalities of\nsurveillance. Justice O Chinnappa Reddy speaking for a Bench of two judges of this\nCourt recognised the need for surveillance on habitual and potential offenders. In his\nview:\n\u201cPrevention of crime is one of the prime purposes of the constitution\nof a police force. The preamble to the Police Act, 1861 says:\n\u201cWhereas it is expedient to reorganise the police and to make it a\nmore efficient instrument for the prevention and detection of crime.\u201d\nSection 23 of the Police Act prescribes it as the duty of police\nofficers \u201cto collect and communicate intelligence affecting the public\npeace; to prevent the commission of offences and public\nnuisances\u201d. In connection with these duties it will be necessary to\nkeep discreet surveillance over reputed bad characters, habitual\noffenders and other potential offenders. Organised crime cannot be\nsuccessfully fought without close watch of suspects. But,\nsurveillance may be intrusive and it may so seriously encroach\non the privacy of a citizen as to infringe his fundamental right\nto personal liberty guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution\nand the freedom of movement guaranteed by Article 19(1)(d). That\ncannot be permitted. This is recognised by the Punjab Police Rules\nthemselves. Rule 23.7, which prescribes the mode of surveillance,\npermits the close watch over the movements of the person under\nsurveillance but without any illegal interference. Permissible\nsurveillance is only to the extent of a close watch over the\nmovements of the person under surveillance and no more. So long\nas surveillance is for the purpose of preventing crime and is\nconfined to the limits prescribed by Rule 23.7 we do not think a\nperson whose name is included in the surveillance register can\nhave a genuine cause for complaint. We may notice here that\ninterference in accordance with law and for the prevention of\ndisorder and crime is an exception recognised even by European\nConvention of Human Rights to the right to respect for a person's\nprivate and family life. Article 8 of the Convention reads as follows:\n46\nPART H\n\u201c(1) Everyone's right to respect for his private and\nfamily life, his home and his correspondence shall be\nrecognised.\n(2) There shall be no interference by a public authority\nwith the exercise of this right, except such as is in\naccordance with law and is necessary in a democratic\nsociety in the interests of national security, public\nsafety, for the prevention of disorder and crime or for\nthe protection of health or morals.\u201d\u201d72 (emphasis\nsupplied)\nThe Court did not consider it unlawful for the police to conduct surveillance so long as\nit was for the purpose of preventing crime and was confined to the limits prescribed\nby Rule 23.7 which, while authorising a close watch on the movement of a person\nunder surveillance, contained a condition that this should be without any illegal\ninterference. The object being to prevent crime, the Court held that the person who\nis subject to surveillance is not entitled to access the register nor was a pre-decisional\nhearing compliant with natural justice warranted. Confidentiality, this Court held, was\nrequired in the interest of the public, including keeping in confidence the sources of\ninformation. Again the Court held:\n\u201cBut all this does not mean that the police have a licence to enter\nthe names of whoever they like (dislike?) in the surveillance\nregister; nor can the surveillance be such as to squeeze the\nfundamental freedoms guaranteed to all citizens or to obstruct the\nfree exercise and enjoyment of those freedoms; nor can the\nsurveillance so intrude as to offend the dignity of the individual.\nSurveillance of persons who do not fall within the categories\nmentioned in Rule 23.4 or for reasons unconnected with the\nprevention of crime, or excessive surveillance falling beyond the\nlimits prescribed by the rules, will entitle a citizen to the court's\nprotection which the court will not hesitate to give. The very Rules\n72 Ibid, at pages 424-425 (para 6)\n47\nPART H\nwhich prescribe the conditions for making entries in the surveillance\nregister and the mode of surveillance appear to recognise the\ncaution and care with which the police officers are required to\nproceed. The note following Rule 23.4 is instructive. It enjoins a duty\nupon the police officer to construe the rule strictly and confine the\nentries in the surveillance register to the class of persons mentioned\nin the rule. Similarly Rule 23.7 demands that there should be no\nillegal interference in the guise of surveillance. Surveillance,\ntherefore, has to be unobtrusive and within bounds.\u201d73\nThe observations in Malak Singh on the issue of privacy indicate that an\nencroachment on privacy infringes personal liberty under Article 21 and the right to\nthe freedom of movement under Article 19(1)(d). Without specifically holding that\nprivacy is a protected constitutional value under Article 19 or Article 21, the judgment\nof this Court indicates that serious encroachments on privacy impinge upon personal\nliberty and the freedom of movement. The Court linked such an encroachment with\nthe dignity of the individual which would be offended by surveillance bereft of\nprocedural protections and carried out in a manner that would obstruct the free\nexercise of freedoms guaranteed by the fundamental rights.\n52 State of Maharashtra v Madhukar Narayan Mardikar74 is another decision by\na two-judge Bench which dealt with a case of a police inspector who was alleged to\nhave attempted to have non-consensual intercourse with a woman by entering the\nhutment where she lived. Following an enquiry, he was dismissed from service but\nthe punishment was modified, in appeal, to removal so as to enable him to apply for\n73 Ibid, at page 426 (para 9)\n74 (1991) 1 SCC 57\n48\nPART H\npensionary benefits. The High Court quashed the punishment both on the ground of\na violation of the principles of natural justice, and by questioning the character of the\nvictim. Holding that this approach of the High Court was misconceived, Justice A M\nAhmadi (as the learned Chief Justice then was) held that though the victim had\nadmitted \u201cthe dark side of her life\u201d, she was yet entitled to her privacy :\n\u201cThe High Court observes that since Banubi is an unchaste woman\nit would be extremely unsafe to allow the fortune and career of a\ngovernment official to be put in jeopardy upon the uncorroborated\nversion of such a woman who makes no secret of her illicit intimacy\nwith another person. She was honest enough to admit the dark side\nof her life. Even a woman of easy virtue is entitled to privacy\nand no one can invade her privacy as and when he likes. So\nalso it is not open to any and every person to violate her\nperson as and when he wishes. She is entitled to protect her\nperson if there is an attempt to violate it against her wish. She\nis equally entitled to the protection of law. Therefore, merely\nbecause she is a woman of easy virtue, her evidence cannot\nbe thrown overboard. At the most the officer called upon to\nevaluate her evidence would be required to administer caution unto\nhimself before accepting her evidence.\u201d75 (emphasis supplied)\nAs the above extract indicates, the issue before this Court was essentially based on\nthe appreciation of the evidence of the victim by the High Court. However, the\nobservations of this Court make a strong statement of the bodily integrity of a woman,\nas an incident of her privacy.\n53 The decision In Life Insurance Corporation of India v Prof Manubhai D\nShah76, incorrectly attributed to the decision in Indian Express Newspapers\n75 Ibid, at pages 62-63 (para 8)\n76 (1992) 3 SCC 637\n49\nPART H\n(Bombay) Pvt Ltd v Union of India77 the principle that the right to free expression\nunder Article 19(1)(a) includes the privacy of communications. The judgment of this\nCourt in Indian Express cited a U N Report but did no more.\n54 The decision which has assumed some significance is Rajagopal78 . In that\ncase, in a proceeding under Article 32 of the Constitution, a writ was sought for\nrestraining the state and prison authorities from interfering with the publication of an\nautobiography of a condemned prisoner in a magazine. The prison authorities, in a\ncommunication to the publisher, denied the claim that the autobiography had been\nauthored by the prisoner while he was confined to jail and opined that a publication in\nthe name of a convict was against prison rules. The prisoner in question had been\nfound guilty of six murders and was sentenced to death. Among the questions which\nwere posed by this Court for decision was whether a citizen could prevent another\nfrom writing about the life story of the former and whether an unauthorized publication\ninfringes the citizen\u2019s right to privacy. Justice Jeevan Reddy speaking for a Bench of\ntwo judges recognised that the right of privacy has two aspects: the first affording an\naction in tort for damages resulting from an unlawful invasion of privacy, while the\nsecond is a constitutional right. The judgment traces the constitutional protection of\nprivacy to the decisions in Kharak Singh and Gobind. This appears from the\nfollowing observations:\n77 (1985) 1 SCC 641\n78 (1994) 6 SCC 632\n50\nPART H\n\u201c\u2026The first decision of this Court dealing with this aspect is Kharak\nSingh v. State of U.P. [(1964) 1 SCR 332 : AIR 1963 SC 1295 :\n(1963) 2 Cri LJ 329] A more elaborate appraisal of this right took\nplace in a later decision in Gobind v.State of M.P.[(1975) 2 SCC\n148 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 468] wherein Mathew, J. speaking for himself,\nKrishna Iyer and Goswami, JJ. traced the origins of this right and\nalso pointed out how the said right has been dealt with by the United\nStates Supreme Court in two of its well-known decisions\nin Griswold v. Connecticut [381 US 479 : 14 L Ed 2d 510 (1965)]\nand Roe v. Wade [410 US 113 : 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973)]\u2026\u201d79\nThe decision in Rajagopal considers the decisions in Kharak Singh and Gobind thus:\n\u201c\u2026 Kharak Singh [(1964) 1 SCR 332 : AIR 1963 SC 1295 : (1963)\n2 Cri LJ 329] was a case where the petitioner was put under\nsurveillance as defined in Regulation 236 of the U.P. Police\nRegulations\u2026\nThough right to privacy was referred to, the decision turned on the\nmeaning and content of \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d and \u201clife\u201d in Article\n21. Gobind [(1975) 2 SCC 148 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 468] was also a\ncase of surveillance under M.P. Police Regulations. Kharak\nSingh [(1964) 1 SCR 332 : AIR 1963 SC 1295 : (1963) 2 Cri LJ 329]\nwas followed even while at the same time elaborating the right to\nprivacy\u2026\u201d80\nThe Court held that neither the State nor its officials can impose prior restrictions on\nthe publication of an autobiography of a convict. In the course of its summary of the\ndecision, the Court held:\n79 Ibid, at pages 639-640 (para 9)\n80 Ibid, at page 643 (para 13)\n51\nPART H\n\u201c(1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\nguaranteed to the citizens of this country by Article 21. It is a \u201cright\nto be let alone\u201d. A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his\nhome, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing\nand education among other matters. None can publish anything\nconcerning the above matters without his consent \u2014 whether\ntruthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so,\nhe would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned\nand would be liable in an action for damages. Position may,\nhowever, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into\ncontroversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n(2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any\npublication concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes\nunobjectionable if such publication is based upon public records\nincluding court records. This is for the reason that once a matter\nbecomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer\nsubsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press\nand media among others. We are, however, of the opinion that in\nthe interests of decency [Article 19(2)] an exception must be carved\nout to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual assault,\nkidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further be subjected\nto the indignity of her name and the incident being publicised in\npress/media.\n(3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above \u2014 indeed,\nthis is not an exception but an independent rule. In the case of\npublic officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the\nremedy of action for damages is simply not available with respect\nto their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their official\nduties. This is so even where the publication is based upon facts\nand statements which are not true, unless the official establishes\nthat the publication was made (by the defendant) with reckless\ndisregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for the\ndefendant (member of the press or media) to prove that he acted\nafter a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary for\nhim to prove that what he has written is true. Of course, where the\npublication is proved to be false and actuated by malice or personal\nanimosity, the defendant would have no defence and would be\nliable for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant\nto the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same\nprotection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above. It\nneeds no reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the power\nto punish for contempt of court and Parliament and legislatures\nprotected as their privileges are by Articles 105 and 104\n52\nPART H\nrespectively of the Constitution of India, represent exceptions to this\nrule\u2026\u201d81\n55 The judgment of Justice Jeevan Reddy regards privacy as implicit in the right\nto life and personal liberty under Article 21. In coming to the conclusion, the judgment\nin Rajagopal notes that while Kharak Singh had referred to the right of privacy, the\ndecision turned on the content of life and personal liberty in Article 21. The decision\nrecognises privacy as a protected constitutional right, while tracing it to Article 21.\n56 In an interesting research article on \u2018State\u2019s surveillance and the right to\nprivacy\u2019, a contemporary scholar has questioned the theoretical foundation of the\ndecision in Rajagopal on the ground that the case essentially dealt with cases in the\nUS concerning privacy against governmental intrusion which was irrelevant in the\nfactual situation before this Court.82 In the view of the author, Rajagopal involved a\npublication of an article by a private publisher in a magazine, authored by a private\nindividual, albeit a convict. Hence the decision has been criticized on the ground that\nRajagopal was about an action between private parties and, therefore, ought to have\ndealt with privacy in the context of tort law.83 While it is true that in Rajagopal it is a\nprivate publisher who was seeking to publish an article about a death row convict, it\nis equally true that the Court dealt with a prior restraint on publication imposed by the\n81 Ibid, at pages 649-650 (para 26)\n82 Gautam Bhatia, \u201cState Surveillance and the Right to Privacy in India: A Constitutional Biography\u201d, National\nLaw School of India Review (2014), Vol. 26(2), at pages 138-139\n83 Ibid\n53\nPART H\nstate and its prison officials. That is, in fact, how Article 32 was invoked by the\npublisher.\n57 The intersection between privacy and medical jurisprudence has been dealt\nwith in a series of judgments of this Court, among them being Mr X v Hospital Z84 .\nIn that case, the appellant was a doctor in the health service of a state. He was\naccompanying a patient for surgery from Nagaland to Chennai and was tested when\nhe was to donate blood. The blood sample was found to be HIV+. The appellant\nclaiming to have been socially ostracized by the disclosure of his HIV+ status by the\nhospital, filed a claim for damages before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal\nCommission (NCDRC) alleging that the hospital had unauthorizedly disclosed his HIV\nstatus resulting in his marriage being called off and in social opprobrium. Justice\nSaghir Ahmad, speaking for a Bench of two judges of this Court, adverted to the duty\nof the doctor to maintain secrecy in relation to the patient but held that there is an\nexception to the rule of confidentiality where public interest will override that duty. The\njudgment of this Court dwelt on the right of privacy under Article 21 and other\nprovisions of the Constitution relating to the fundamental rights and the Directive\nPrinciples:\n\u201cRight to privacy has been culled out of the provisions of Article 21\nand other provisions of the Constitution relating to the Fundamental\nRights read with the Directive Principles of State Policy. It was in\nthis context that it was held by this Court in Kharak Singh v. State\nof U.P. [AIR 1963 SC 1295 : (1964) 1 SCR 332] that police\nsurveillance of a person by domiciliary visits would be violative of\n84 (1998) 8 SCC 296\n54\nPART H\nArticle 21 of the Constitution. This decision was considered by\nMathew, J. in his classic judgment in Gobind v. State of\nM.P. [(1975) 2 SCC 148 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 468] in which the origin\nof \u201cright to privacy\u201d was traced and a number of American decisions,\nincluding Munn v. Illinois [94 US 113 : 24 L Ed 77 (1877)]\n, Wolf v. Colorado [338 US 25 : 93 L Ed 1782 (1949)] and various\narticles were considered\u2026\u201d85\nThe Court read the decision in Malak Singh as reiterating the view taken earlier, on\nprivacy in Kharak Singh and Gobind. The Court proceeded to rely on the decision\nin Rajagopal. The Court held that the right to privacy is not absolute and is subject to\naction lawfully taken to prevent crime or disorder or to protect the health, morals and\nthe rights and freedoms of others. Public disclosure of even true facts, the Court held,\nmay amount to invasion of the right to privacy or the right to be let alone when a doctor\nbreaches confidentiality. The Court held that:\n\u201cDisclosure of even true private facts has the tendency to disturb a\nperson's tranquillity. It may generate many complexes in him and\nmay even lead to psychological problems. He may, thereafter, have\na disturbed life all through. In the face of these potentialities, and as\nalready held by this Court in its various decisions referred to above,\nthe right of privacy is an essential component of the right to life\nenvisaged by Article 21. The right, however, is not absolute and\nmay be lawfully restricted for the prevention of crime, disorder or\nprotection of health or morals or protection of rights and freedom of\nothers.\u201d86\nHowever, the disclosure that the appellant was HIV+ was held not to be violative of\nthe right to privacy of the appellant on the ground that the woman to whom he was to\n85 Ibid, at page 305 (para 21)\n86 Ibid, at page 307 (para 28)\n55\nPART H\nbe married \u201cwas saved in time by such disclosure and from the risk of being infected\u201d.\nThe denial of a claim for compensation by the NCDRC was upheld.\n58 The decision in Mr X v Hospital Z fails to adequately appreciate that the latter\npart of the decision in Kharak Singh declined to accept privacy as a constitutional\nright, while the earlier part invalidated domiciliary visits in the context of an invasion\nof \u2018ordered liberty\u2019. Similarly, several observations in Gobind proceed on an\nassumption: if there is a right of privacy, it would comprehend certain matters and\nwould be subject to a regulation to protect compelling state interests.\n59 In a decision of a Bench of two judges of this Court in PUCL87, the Court dealt\nwith telephone tapping. The petitioner challenged the constitutional validity of Section\n5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and urged in the alternative for adopting\nprocedural safeguards to curb arbitrary acts of telephone tapping. Section 5(2)\nauthorises the interception of messages in transmission in the following terms:\n\u201cOn the occurrence of any public emergency, or in the interest of\nthe public safety, the Central Government or a State Government\nor any officer specially unauthorised in this behalf by the Central\nGovernment or a State Government may, if satisfied that it is\nnecessary or expedient so to do in the interests of the sovereignty\nand integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with\nforeign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the\ncommission of an offence, for reasons to be recorded in writing, by\norder, direct that any message or class of messages to or from any\nperson or class of persons, or relating to any particular subject,\nbrought for transmission by or transmitted or received by any\n87 (1997) 1 SCC 301\n56\nPART H\ntelegraph, shall not be transmitted, or shall be intercepted or\ndetained, or shall be disclosed to the Government making the order\nor an officer thereof mentioned in the order:\nProvided that press messages intended to be published in India of\ncorrespondents accredited to the Central Government or a State\nGovernment shall not be intercepted or detained, unless their\ntransmission has been prohibited under this sub-section.\u201d\n60 The submission on the invalidity of the statutory provision authorising telephone\ntapping was based on the right to privacy being a fundamental right under Articles\n19(1) and 21 of the Constitution. Justice Kuldip Singh adverted to the observations\ncontained in the majority judgment in Kharak Singh which led to the invalidation of\nthe provision for domiciliary visits at night under Regulation 236(b). PUCL cited the\nminority view of Justice Subba Rao as having gone even further by invalidating\nRegulation 236, in its entirety. The judgment, therefore, construes both the majority\nand minority judgments as having affirmed the right to privacy as a part of Article 21:\n\u201cArticle 21 of the Constitution has, therefore, been interpreted by all\nthe seven learned Judges in Kharak Singh case [(1964) 1 SCR 332\n: AIR 1963 SC 1295] (majority and the minority opinions) to include\nthat \u201cright to privacy\u201d as a part of the right to \u201cprotection of life and\npersonal liberty\u201d guaranteed under the said Article.\u201d88\nGobind was construed to have upheld the validity of State Police Regulations\nproviding surveillance on the ground that the \u2018procedure established by law\u2019 under\nArticle 21 had not been violated. After completing its summation of precedents,\nJustice Kuldip Singh held as follows:\n88 Ibid, at page 310 (para 14)\n57\nPART H\n\u201cWe have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that right to privacy is\na part of the right to \u201clife\u201d and \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d enshrined under\nArticle 21 of the Constitution. Once the facts in a given case\nconstitute a right to privacy, Article 21 is attracted. The said right\ncannot be curtained \u201cexcept according to procedure established by\nlaw\u201d.\u201d89\nTelephone conversations were construed to be an important ingredient of privacy and\nthe tapping of such conversations was held to infringe Article 21, unless permitted by\n\u2018procedure established by law\u2019 :\n\u201cThe right to privacy \u2014 by itself \u2014 has not been identified under the\nConstitution. As a concept it may be too broad and moralistic to\ndefine it judicially. Whether right to privacy can be claimed or has\nbeen infringed in a given case would depend on the facts of the said\ncase. But the right to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy\nof one's home or office without interference can certainly be claimed\nas \u201cright to privacy\u201d. Conversations on the telephone are often of an\nintimate and confidential character. Telephone conversation is a\npart of modern man's life. It is considered so important that more\nand more people are carrying mobile telephone instruments in their\npockets. Telephone conversation is an important facet of a man's\nprivate life. Right to privacy would certainly include telephone\nconversation in the privacy of one's home or office. Telephone-\ntapping would, thus, infract Article 21 of the Constitution of India\nunless it is permitted under the procedure established by law.\u201d90\nThe Court also held that telephone tapping infringes the guarantee of free speech and\nexpression under Article 19(1)(a) unless authorized by Article 19(2). The judgment\nrelied on the protection of privacy under Article 17 of the International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights (and a similar guarantee under Article 12 of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights) which, in its view, must be an interpretative tool for\n89 Ibid, at page 311 (para 17)\n90 Ibid, at page 311 (para 18)\n58\nPART H\nconstruing the provisions of the Constitution. Article 21, in the view of the Court, has\nto be interpreted in conformity with international law. In the absence of rules providing\nfor the precautions to be adopted for preventing improper interception and/or\ndisclosure of messages, the fundamental rights under Articles 19(1)(a) and 21 could\nnot be safeguarded. But the Court was not inclined to require prior judicial scrutiny\nbefore intercepting telephone conversations. The Court ruled that it would be\nnecessary to lay down procedural safeguards for the protection of the right to privacy\nof a person until Parliament intervened by framing rules under Section 7 of the\nTelegraph Act. The Court accordingly framed guidelines to be adopted in all cases\nenvisaging telephone tapping.\n61 The judgment in PUCL construes the earlier decisions in Kharak Singh\n(especially the majority view on the invalidity of domiciliary visits), Gobind and\nRajagopal in holding that the right to privacy is embodied as a constitutionally\nprotected right under Article 21. The Court was conscious of the fact that the right to\nprivacy has \u201cby itself\u201d not been identified under the Constitution. The expression \u201cby\nitself\u201d may indicate one of two meanings. The first is that the Constitution does not\nrecognise a standalone right to privacy. The second recognizes that there is no\nexpress delineation of such a right. Evidently, the Court left the evolution of the\ncontours of the right to a case by case determination. Telephone conversations from\nthe home or office were construed to be an integral element of the privacy of an\nindividual. In PUCL, the Court consciously established the linkages between various\narticles conferring guarantees of fundamental rights when it noted that wire-tapping\n59\nPART H\ninfringes privacy and in consequence the right to life and personal liberty under Article\n21 and the freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a). The need to\nread the fundamental constitutional guarantees with a purpose illuminated by India\u2019s\ncommitment to the international regime of human rights\u2019 protection also weighed in\nthe decision. Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act was to be regulated by rules framed\nby the Government to render the modalities of telephone tapping fair, just and\nreasonable under Article 21. The importance which the Court ascribes to privacy is\nevident from the fact that it did not await the eventual formulation of rules by\nParliament and prescribed that in the meantime, certain procedural safeguards which\nit envisaged should be put into place.\n62 While dealing with a case involving the rape of an eight year old child, a three-\njudge Bench of this Court in State of Karnataka v Krishnappa91 held:\n\u201cSexual violence apart from being\u2026 dehumanising\u2026 is an unlawful\nintrusion of the right to privacy and sanctity\u2026 It\u2026 offends her\u2026\ndignity.\u201d92\nSimilar observations were made in Sudhansu Sekhar Sahoo v State of Orissa93.\n63 In Sharda v Dharmpal94, the appellant and respondent were spouses. The\nrespondent sued for divorce and filed an application for conducting a medical\nexamination of the appellant which was opposed. The Trial Court allowed the\n91 (2000) 4 SCC 75\n92 Ibid, at page 82 (para 15)\n93 (2002) 10 SCC 743\n94 (2003) 4 SCC 493\n60\nPART H\napplication. The High Court dismissed the challenge in a Civil Revision which led the\nappellant to move this Court. The appellant argued before this Court that compelling\nher to undergo a medical examination violated her personal liberty under Article 21\nand that in the absence of an empowering provision, the matrimonial Court had no\njurisdiction to compel a party to undergo a medical examination. Justice S B Sinha,\nspeaking for the Bench of three judges, dealt with the first aspect of the matter\n(whether a matrimonial Court has jurisdiction to order a medical examination) in the\nfollowing terms:\n\u201cEven otherwise the court may issue an appropriate direction so as\nto satisfy itself as to whether apart from treatment he requires\nadequate protection inter alia by way of legal aid so that he may not\nbe subject to an unjust order because of his incapacity. Keeping in\nview of the fact that in a case of mental illness the court has\nadequate power to examine the party or get him examined by a\nqualified doctor, we are of the opinion that in an appropriate case\nthe court may take recourse to such a procedure even at the\ninstance of the party to the lis95\u2026\nFurthermore, the court must be held to have the requisite power\neven under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure to issue\nsuch direction either suo motu or otherwise which, according to him,\nwould lead to the truth.96\u201d\n64 The second question considered by the Court was whether a compulsive\nsubjecting of a person to a medical examination violates Article 21. After noticing the\nobservations in M P Sharma and Kharak Singh where it was held that the\nConstitution has not guaranteed the right of privacy, the Court held that in subsequent\ndecisions, such a right has been read into Article 21 on an expansive interpretation of\n95 Ibid, at page 513 (para 52)\n96 Ibid, at page 513 (para 53)\n61\nPART H\npersonal liberty. In the course of its judgment, the Court adverted to the decisions in\nRajagopal, PUCL, Gobind and Mr X v Hospital Z on the basis of which it stated that\nit had \u201coutlined the law relating to privacy in India\u201d. In the view of this Court, in\nmatrimonial cases where a decree of divorce is sought on medical grounds, a medical\nexamination is the only way in which an allegation could be proved. In such a situation:\n\u201cIf the respondent avoids such medical examination on the ground\nthat it violates his/her right to privacy or for that matter right to\npersonal liberty as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of\nIndia, then it may in most of such cases become impossible to arrive\nat a conclusion. It may render the very grounds on which divorce is\npermissible nugatory. Therefore, when there is no right to privacy\nspecifically conferred by Article 21 of the Constitution of India and\nwith the extensive interpretation of the phrase \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d this\nright has been read into Article 21, it cannot be treated as an\nabsolute right\u2026\u201d97\nThe right of privacy was held not to be breached.\n65 In District Registrar and Collector, Hyderabad v Canara Bank98 (\u201cCanara\nBank\u201d), a Bench of two judges of this Court considered the provisions of the Indian\nStamp Act, 1899 (as amended by a special law in Andhra Pradesh). Section 73, which\nwas invalidated by the High Court, empowered the Collector to inspect registers,\nbooks and records, papers, documents and proceedings in the custody of any public\nofficer \u2018to secure any duty or to prove or would lead to the discovery of a fraud or\nomission\u2019. Section 73 was in the following terms:\n97 Ibid, at page 523 (para 76)\n98 (2005) 1 SCC 496\n62\nPART H\n\u201c73. Every public officer having in his custody any registers, books,\nrecords, papers, documents or proceedings, the inspection whereof\nmay tend to secure any duty, or to prove or lead to the discovery of\nany fraud or omission in relation to any duty, shall at all reasonable\ntimes permit any person authorised in writing by the Collector to\ninspect for such purpose the registers, books, papers, documents\nand proceedings, and to take such notes and extracts as he may\ndeem necessary, without fee or charge.\u201d\nAfter adverting to the evolution of the doctrine of privacy in the US from a right\nassociated with property99 to a right associated with the individual100, Chief Justice\nLahoti referred to the penumbras created by the Bill of Rights resulting in a zone of\nprivacy101 leading up eventually to a \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d102. Chief\nJustice Lahoti considered the decision in M P Sharma to be \u201cof limited help\u201d to the\ndiscussion on privacy. However, it was Kharak Singh which invalidated nightly-\ndomiciliary visits that provided guidance on the issue. The evaluation of Kharak\nSingh was in the following terms:\n\u201cIn\u2026Kharak Singh v State of U P [(1964) 1 SCR 332 : (1963) 2\nCri LJ 329] the U.P. Regulations regarding domiciliary visits were in\nquestion and the majority referred to Munn v. Illinois [94 US 113\n: 24 L Ed 77 (1877)] and held that though our Constitution did\nnot refer to the right to privacy expressly, still it can be traced\nfrom the right to \u201clife\u201d in Article 21. According to the majority,\nclause 236 of the relevant Regulations in U.P., was bad in law; it\noffended Article 21 inasmuch as there was no law permitting\ninterference by such visits. The majority did not go into the question\nwhether these visits violated the \u201cright to privacy\u201d. But, Subba Rao,\nJ. while concurring that the fundamental right to privacy was part of\nthe right to liberty in Article 21, part of the right to freedom of speech\nand expression in Article 19(1)(a), and also of the right to movement\nin Article 19(1)(d), held that the Regulations permitting surveillance\n99 Boyd v United States, 116 US 616 (1886)\n100 Olmstead v United States, 277 US 438 (1928)\n101 Griswold v State of Connecticut, 381 US 479 (1965)\n102 Katz v United States, 389 US 347 (1967)\n63\nPART H\nviolated the fundamental right of privacy. In the discussion the\nlearned Judge referred to Wolf v. Colorado [338 US 25 : 93 L Ed\n1782 (1949)] . In effect, all the seven learned Judges held that\nthe \u201cright to privacy\u201d was part of the right to \u201clife\u201d in Article\n21.\u201d103 (emphasis supplied)\nThe decision in Gobind is construed to have implied the right to privacy in Articles\n19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution:\n\u201cWe have referred in detail to the reasons given by Mathew, J.\nin Gobind to show that, the right to privacy has been implied\nin Articles 19(1)(a) and (d) and Article 21; that, the right is not\nabsolute and that any State intrusion can be a reasonable\nrestriction only if it has reasonable basis or reasonable materials to\nsupport it.\u201d104 (emphasis supplied)\nThe Court dealt with the application of Section 73 of the Indian Stamp Act (as\namended), to documents of a customer in the possession of a bank. The Court held:\n\u201cOnce we have accepted in Gobind [(1975) 2 SCC 148 : 1975 SCC\n(Cri) 468] and in later cases that the right to privacy deals with\n\u201cpersons and not places\u201d, the documents or copies of documents of\nthe customer which are in a bank, must continue to remain\nconfidential vis-\u00e0-vis the person, even if they are no longer at the\ncustomer's house and have been voluntarily sent to a bank. If that\nbe the correct view of the law, we cannot accept the line\nof Miller [425 US 435 (1976)] in which the Court proceeded on the\nbasis that the right to privacy is referable to the right of \u201cproperty\u201d\ntheory. Once that is so, then unless there is some probable or\nreasonable cause or reasonable basis or material before the\nCollector for reaching an opinion that the documents in the\npossession of the bank tend to secure any duty or to prove or to\nlead to the discovery of any fraud or omission in relation to any duty,\nthe search or taking notes or extracts therefore, cannot be valid.\nThe above safeguards must necessarily be read into the provision\n103 Supra Note 95, at page 516 (para 36)\n104 Ibid, at page 518 (para 39)\n64\nPART H\nrelating to search and inspection and seizure so as to save it from\nany unconstitutionality.\u201d105\nHence the Court repudiated the notion that a person who places documents with a\nbank would, as a result, forsake an expectation of confidentiality. In the view of the\nCourt, even if the documents cease to be at a place other than in the custody and\ncontrol of the customer, privacy attaches to persons and not places and hence the\nprotection of privacy is not diluted. Moreover, in the view of the Court, there has to be\na reasonable basis or material for the Collector to form an opinion that the documents\nin the possession of the bank would secure the purpose of investigating into an act of\nfraud or an omission in relation to duty. The safeguards which the Court introduced\nwere regarded as being implicit in the need to make a search of this nature\nreasonable. The second part of the ruling of the Court is equally important for it finds\nfault with a statutory provision which allows an excessive delegation of the power\nconferred upon the Collector to inspect documents. The provision, the Court rules,\nwould allow the customers\u2019 privacy to be breached by non-governmental persons.\nHence the statute, insofar as it allowed the Collector to authorize any person to seek\ninspection, would be unenforceable. In the view of the Court:\n\u201cSecondly, the impugned provision in Section 73 enabling the\nCollector to authorise \u201cany person\u201d whatsoever to inspect, to take\nnotes or extracts from the papers in the public office suffers from\nthe vice of excessive delegation as there are no guidelines in the\nAct and more importantly, the section allows the facts relating to the\ncustomer's privacy to reach non-governmental persons and would,\non that basis, be an unreasonable encroachment into the\ncustomer's rights. This part of Section 73 permitting delegation to\n105 Ibid, at page 523 (para 53)\n65\nPART H\n\u201cany person\u201d suffers from the above serious defects and for that\nreason is, in our view, unenforceable. The State must clearly define\nthe officers by designation or state that the power can be delegated\nto officers not below a particular rank in the official hierarchy, as\nmay be designated by the State.\u201d106\n66 The significance of the judgment in Canara Bank lies first in its reaffirmation of\nthe right to privacy as emanating from the liberties guaranteed by Article 19 and from\nthe protection of life and personal liberty under Article 21. Secondly, the Court finds\nthe foundation for the reaffirmation of this right not only in the judgments in Kharak\nSingh and Gobind and the cases which followed, but also in terms of India\u2019s\ninternational commitments under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)\nand International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Thirdly, the right to\nprivacy is construed as a right which attaches to the person. The significance of this\nis that the right to privacy is not lost as a result of confidential documents or information\nbeing parted with by the customer to the custody of the bank. Fourthly, the Court\nemphasised the need to read procedural safeguards to ensure that the power of\nsearch and seizure of the nature contemplated by Section 73 is not exercised\narbitrarily. Fifthly, access to bank records to the Collector does not permit a delegation\nof those powers by the Collector to a private individual. Hence even when the power\nto inspect and search is validly exercisable by an organ of the state, necessary\nsafeguards would be required to ensure that the information does not travel to\nunauthorised private hands. Sixthly, information provided by an individual to a third\nparty (in that case a bank) carries with it a reasonable expectation that it will be utilised\n106 Ibid, at page 524 (para 54)\n66\nPART H\nonly for the purpose for which it is provided. Parting with information (to the bank)\ndoes not deprive the individual of the privacy interest. The reasonable expectation is\nallied to the purpose for which information is provided. Seventhly, while legitimate\naims of the state, such as the protection of the revenue may intervene to permit a\ndisclosure to the state, the state must take care to ensure that the information is not\naccessed by a private entity. The decision in Canara Bank has thus important\nconsequences for recognising informational privacy.\n67 After the decision in Canara Bank, the provisions for search and seizure under\nSection 132(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 were construed strictly by this Court in P\nR Metrani v Commissioner of Income Tax107 on the ground that they constitute a\n\u201cserious intrusion into the privacy of a citizen\u201d. Similarly, the search and seizure\nprovisions of Sections 42 and 43 of the NDPS108 Act were construed by this Court in\nDirectorate of Revenue v Mohd Nisar Holia109. Adverting to Canara Bank, among\nother decisions, the Court held that the right to privacy is crucial and imposes a\nrequirement of a written recording of reasons before a search and seizure could be\ncarried out.\n68 Section 30 of the Punjab Excise Act, 1914 prohibited the employment of \u201cany\nman under the age of 25 years\u201d or \u201cany woman\u201d in any part of the premises in which\n107 (2007) 1 SCC 789\n108 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985\n109 (2008) 2 SCC 370\n67\nPART H\nliquor or an intoxicating drug is consumed by the public. The provision was also\nchallenged in Anuj Garg v Hotel Association of India110 on the ground that it violates\nthe right to privacy. While holding that the provision is ultra vires, the two-judge Bench\nobserved:\n\u201cPrivacy rights prescribe autonomy to choose profession\nwhereas security concerns texture methodology of delivery of this\nassurance. But it is a reasonable proposition that that the measures\nto safeguard such a guarantee of autonomy should not be so strong\nthat the essence of the guarantee is lost. State protection must not\ntranslate into censorship111\u2026\nInstead of prohibiting women employment in the bars altogether the\nstate should focus on factoring in ways through which unequal\nconsequences of sex differences can be eliminated. It is state\u2019s duty\nto ensure circumstances of safety which inspire confidence in\nwomen to discharge the duty freely in accordance to the\nrequirements of the profession they choose to follow. Any other\npolicy inference (such as the one embodied under Section 30)\nfrom societal conditions would be oppressive on the women\nand against the privacy rights112\u2026\nThe Court\u2019s task is to determine whether the measures\nfurthered by the State in form of legislative mandate, to\naugment the legitimate aim of protecting the interests of\nwomen are proportionate to the other bulk of well-settled\ngender norms such as autonomy, equality of opportunity, right\nto privacy et al.113\u201d (emphasis supplied)\n69 In Hinsa Virodhak Sangh v Mirzapur Moti Kuresh Jamat114 (\u201cHinsa\nVirodhak Sangh\u201d), this Court dealt with the closure of municipal slaughterhouses in\nthe city of Ahmedabad for a period of nine days each year during the Jain observance\n110 (2008) 3 SCC 1\n111 Ibid, at page 15 (para 35)\n112 Ibid, at pages 16-17 (para 43)\n113 Ibid, at page 19 (para 51)\n114 (2008) 5 SCC 33\n68\nPART H\nof paryushan, pursuant to the resolution of the municipal corporation. The High Court\nhad set aside the resolutions. In appeal, this Court observed as follows:\n\u201cHad the impugned resolutions ordered closure of municipal\nslaughterhouses for a considerable period of time we may have\nheld the impugned resolutions to be invalid being an excessive\nrestriction on the rights of the butchers of Ahmedabad who practise\ntheir profession of meat selling. After all, butchers are practising a\ntrade and it is their fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g) of the\nConstitution which is guaranteed to all citizens of India. Moreover,\nit is not a matter of the proprietor of the butchery shop alone. There\nmay be also several workmen therein who may become\nunemployed if the slaughterhouses are closed for a considerable\nperiod of time, because one of the conditions of the licence given\nto the shop-owners is to supply meat regularly in the city of\nAhmedabad and this supply comes from the municipal\nslaughterhouses of Ahmedabad. Also, a large number of people are\nnon-vegetarian and they cannot be compelled to become\nvegetarian for a long period. What one eats is one's personal\naffair and it is a part of his right to privacy which is included in\nArticle 21 of our Constitution as held by several decisions of\nthis Court. In R. Rajagopal v. State of T.N. [(1994) 6 SCC 632 :\nAIR 1995 SC 264] (vide SCC para 26 : AIR para 28) this Court held\nthat the right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\nguaranteed by Article 21. It is a \u201cright to be let alone\u201d.\u201d115\n(emphasis supplied)\nHowever, since the closure of slaughterhouses was for a period of nine days, the\nCourt came to the conclusion that it did not encroach upon the freedom guaranteed\nby Article 19(1)(g). The restriction was held not to be excessive.\n115 Ibid, at pages 46-47 (para 27)\n69\nPART H\n70 The decision in the State of Maharashtra v Bharat Shanti Lal Shah116 deals\nwith the constitutional validity of Sections 13 to 16 of the Maharashtra Control of\nOrganized Crime Act (MCOCA) which inter alia contains provisions for intercepting\ntelephone and wireless communications. Upholding the provision, the Court\nobserved:\n\u201cThe object of MCOCA is to prevent the organised crime and a\nperusal of the provisions of the Act under challenge would indicate\nthat the said law authorises the interception of wire, electronic or\noral communication only if it is intended to prevent the commission\nof an organised crime or if it is intended to collect the evidence to\nthe commission of such an organised crime. The procedures\nauthorising such interception are also provided therein with enough\nprocedural safeguards, some of which are indicated and discussed\nhereinbefore.\u201d117\nThe safeguards that the Court adverts to in the above extract include Section 14,\nwhich requires details of the organized crime that is being committed or is about to be\ncommitted, before surveillance could be authorized. The requirements also mandate\ndescribing the nature and location of the facilities from which the communication is to\nbe intercepted, the nature of the communication and the identity of the person, if it is\nknown. A statement is also necessary on whether other modes of enquiry or\nintelligence gathering were tried or had failed or why they reasonably appear to be\nunlikely to succeed if tried or whether these would be too dangerous or would likely\nresult in the identification of those connected with the operation. The duration of the\nsurveillance is restricted in time and the provision requires \u201cminimal interception\u201d118.\n116 (2008) 13 SCC 5\n117 Ibid, at page 28 (para 61)\n118 Gautam Bhatia (supra note 82), at page 148\n70\nPART H\n71 During the course of the last decade, this Court has had occasion to deal with\nthe autonomy of a woman and, as an integral part, her control over the body. Suchita\nSrivastava v Chandigarh Administration119 (\u201cSuchita Srivastava\u201d) arose in the\ncontext of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTP) Act, 1971. A woman who\nwas alleged to have been raped while residing in a welfare institution run by the\ngovernment was pregnant. The district administration moved the High Court to seek\ntermination of the pregnancy. The High Court directed that the pregnancy be\nterminated though medical experts had opined that the victim had expressed her\nwillingness to bear the child. The High Court had issued this direction without the\nconsent of the woman which was mandated under the statute where the woman is a\nmajor and does not suffer from a mental illness. The woman in this case was found to\nsuffer from a case of mild to moderate mental retardation. Speaking for a Bench of\nthree judges, Chief Justice Balakrishnan held that the reproductive choice of the\nwoman should be respected having regard to the mandate of Section 3. In the view\nof the Court:\n\u201cThere is no doubt that a woman's right to make reproductive\nchoices is also a dimension of \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d as understood\nunder Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It is important to\nrecognise that reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate\nas well as to abstain from procreating. The crucial consideration\nis that a woman's right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity\nshould be respected. This means that there should be no\nrestriction whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive choices such\nas a woman's right to refuse participation in sexual activity or\nalternatively the insistence on use of contraceptive methods.\nFurthermore, women are also free to choose birth control methods\nsuch as undergoing sterilisation procedures. Taken to their logical\n119 (2009) 9 SCC 1\n71\nPART H\nconclusion, reproductive rights include a woman's entitlement\nto carry a pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to\nsubsequently raise children. However, in the case of pregnant\nwomen there is also a \u201ccompelling State interest\u201d in protecting the\nlife of the prospective child. Therefore, the termination of a\npregnancy is only permitted when the conditions specified in the\napplicable statute have been fulfilled. Hence, the provisions of the\nMTP Act, 1971 can also be viewed as reasonable restrictions that\nhave been placed on the exercise of reproductive choices.\u201d 120\n(emphasis supplied)\nThe Court noted that the statute requires the consent of a guardian where the woman\nhas not attained majority or is mentally ill. In the view of the Court, there is a distinction\nbetween mental illness and mental retardation and hence the State which was in-\ncharge of the welfare institution was bound to respect the personal autonomy of the\nwoman.\n72 The decision in Suchita Srivastava dwells on the statutory right of a woman\nunder the MTP Act to decide whether or not to consent to a termination of pregnancy\nand to have that right respected where she does not consent to termination. The\nstatutory recognition of the right is relatable to the constitutional right to make\nreproductive choices which has been held to be an ingredient of personal liberty under\nArticle 21. The Court deduced the existence of such a right from a woman\u2019s right to\nprivacy, dignity and bodily integrity.\n120 Ibid, at page 15 (para 22)\n72\nPART H\n73 In Bhavesh Jayanti Lakhani v State of Maharashtra121, this Court dealt with\na challenge to the validity of an arrest warrant issued by a US court and a red corner\nnotice issued by INTERPOL on the ground that the petitioner had, in violation of an\ninterim custody order, returned to India with the child. The Court did not accept the\nsubmission that the CBI, by coordinating with INTERPOL had breached the\npetitioner\u2019s right of privacy. However, during the course of the discussion, this Court\nheld as follows:\n\u201cRight to privacy is not enumerated as a fundamental right either in\nterms of Article 21 of the Constitution of India or otherwise. It,\nhowever, by reason of an elaborate interpretation by this Court\nin Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. [AIR 1963 SC 1295 : (1964) 1 SCR\n332] was held to be an essential ingredient of \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d.\u201d122\n\u201cThis Court, however, in Gobind v. State of M.P. upon taking an\nelaborate view of the matter in regard to right to privacy vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe Madhya Pradesh Police Regulations dealing with surveillance,\nopined that the said Regulations did not violate the \u201cprocedure\nestablished by law\u201d. However, a limited fundamental right to privacy\nas emanating from Articles 19(1)(a), (d) and 21 was upheld, but the\nsame was held to be not absolute wherefore reasonable restrictions\ncould be placed in terms of clause (5) of Article 19.\u201d123\n74 In Selvi v State of Karnataka124 (\u201cSelvi\u201d), a Bench of three judges of this Court\ndealt with a challenge to the validity of three investigative techniques: narco-analysis,\npolygraph test (lie-detector test) and Brain Electrical Activation Profile (BEAP) on the\nground that they implicate the fundamental rights under Articles 20(3) and 21 of the\nConstitution. The Court held that the results obtained through an involuntary\n121 (2009) 9 SCC 551\n122 Ibid, at pages 584-585 (para 102)\n123 Ibid, at page 585 (para 103)\n124 (2010) 7 SCC 263\n73\nPART H\nadministration of these tests are within the scope of a testimonial, attracting the\nprotective shield of Article 20(3) of the Constitution. Chief Justice Balakrishnan\nadverted to the earlier decisions rendered in the context of privacy and noted that thus\nfar, judicial understanding had stressed mostly on the protection of the body and\nphysical actions induced by the state. The Court emphasised that while the right\nagainst self-incrimination is a component of personal liberty under Article 21, privacy\nunder the constitution has a meeting point with Article 20(3) as well. In the view of\nthe Court:\n\u201cThe theory of interrelationship of rights mandates that the right\nagainst self-incrimination should also be read as a component of\n\u201cpersonal liberty\u201d under Article 21. Hence, our understanding of the\n\u201cright to privacy\u201d should account for its intersection with Article\n20(3). Furthermore, the \u201crule against involuntary confessions\u201d as\nembodied in Sections 24, 25, 26 and 27 of the Evidence Act, 1872\nseeks to serve both the objectives of reliability as well as\nvoluntariness of testimony given in a custodial setting. A conjunctive\nreading of Articles 20(3) and 21 of the Constitution along with the\nprinciples of evidence law leads us to a clear answer. We must\nrecognise the importance of personal autonomy in aspects such as\nthe choice between remaining silent and speaking. An individual's\ndecision to make a statement is the product of a private choice and\nthere should be no scope for any other individual to interfere with\nsuch autonomy, especially in circumstances where the person\nfaces exposure to criminal charges or penalties\u2026\nTherefore, it is our considered opinion that subjecting a person to\nthe impugned techniques in an involuntary manner violates the\nprescribed boundaries of privacy. Forcible interference with a\nperson's mental processes is not provided for under any statute and\nit most certainly comes into conflict with the \u201cright against self-\nincrimination\u201d.\u201d125\n125 Ibid, at pages 369-370 (paras 225-226)\n74\nPART H\nIn tracing the right to privacy under Article 20(3), as well as Article 21, the decision\nmarks a definite shift away from the M P Sharma rationale. The right not to be\ncompelled to speak or to incriminate oneself when accused of an offence is an\nembodiment of the right to privacy. Selvi indicates how the right to privacy can\nstraddle the ambit of several constitutional rights - in that case, Articles 20(3) and 21.\n75 In Bhabani Prasad Jena v Orissa State Commission for Women126, the Court\nwas considering the question whether the High Court was justified in issuing a\ndirection for a DNA test of a child and the appellant who, according to the mother of\nthe child, was the father. It was held that:\n\u201cIn a matter where paternity of a child is in issue before the court,\nthe use of DNA test is an extremely delicate and sensitive aspect.\nOne view is that when modern science gives the means of\nascertaining the paternity of a child, there should not be any\nhesitation to use those means whenever the occasion requires. The\nother view is that the court must be reluctant in the use of such\nscientific advances and tools which result in invasion of right to\nprivacy of an individual and may not only be prejudicial to the rights\nof the parties but may have devastating effect on the child.\nSometimes the result of such scientific test may bastardise an\ninnocent child even though his mother and her spouse were living\ntogether during the time of conception.\u201d127\n76 In Amar Singh v Union of India128, a Bench of two judges of this Court dealt\nwith a petition under Article 32 alleging that the fundamental right to privacy of the\n126 (2010) 8 SCC 633\n127 Ibid, at page 642 (para 21)\n128 (2011) 7 SCC 69\n75\nPART H\npetitioner was being breached by intercepting his conversations on telephone services\nprovided by a service provider. The Court held:\n\u201cConsidering the materials on record, this Court is of the opinion\nthat it is no doubt true that the service provider has to act on an\nurgent basis and has to act in public interest. But in a given case,\nlike the present one, where the impugned communication dated 9-\n11-2005 is full of gross mistakes, the service provider while\nimmediately acting upon the same, should simultaneously verify the\nauthenticity of the same from the author of the document. This\nCourt is of the opinion that the service provider has to act as a\nresponsible agency and cannot act on any communication.\nSanctity and regularity in official communication in such\nmatters must be maintained especially when the service\nprovider is taking the serious step of intercepting the\ntelephone conversation of a person and by doing so is\ninvading the privacy right of the person concerned and which\nis a fundamental right protected under the Constitution, as has\nbeen held by this Court.\u201d129 (emphasis supplied)\n77 In Ram Jethmalani v Union of India130 (\u201cRam Jethmalani\u201d), a Bench of two\njudges was dealing with a public interest litigation concerned with unaccounted\nmonies and seeking the appointment of a Special Investigating Team to follow and\ninvestigate a money trail. This Court held that the revelation of the details of the bank\naccounts of individuals without the establishment of a prima facie ground of\nwrongdoing would be a violation of the right to privacy. This Court observed thus:\n\u201cRight to privacy is an integral part of right to life. This is a cherished\nconstitutional value, and it is important that human beings be\nallowed domains of freedom that are free of public scrutiny unless\nthey act in an unlawful manner. We understand and appreciate the\nfact that the situation with respect to unaccounted for monies is\n129 Ibid, at page 84 (para 39)\n130 (2011) 8 SCC 1\n76\nPART H\nextremely grave. Nevertheless, as constitutional adjudicators we\nalways have to be mindful of preserving the sanctity of constitutional\nvalues, and hasty steps that derogate from fundamental rights,\nwhether urged by Governments or private citizens, howsoever well\nmeaning they may be, have to be necessarily very carefully\nscrutinised. The solution for the problem of abrogation of one zone\nof constitutional values cannot be the creation of another zone of\nabrogation of constitutional values\u2026\nThe rights of citizens, to effectively seek the protection of\nfundamental rights, under clause (1) of Article 32 have to be\nbalanced against the rights of citizens and persons under Article 21.\nThe latter cannot be sacrificed on the anvil of fervid desire to find\ninstantaneous solutions to systemic problems such as unaccounted\nfor monies, for it would lead to dangerous circumstances, in which\nvigilante investigations, inquisitions and rabble rousing, by masses\nof other citizens could become the order of the day. The right of\ncitizens to petition this Court for upholding of fundamental rights is\ngranted in order that citizens, inter alia, are ever vigilant about the\nfunctioning of the State in order to protect the constitutional project.\nThat right cannot be extended to being inquisitors of fellow citizens.\nAn inquisitorial order, where citizens' fundamental right to\nprivacy is breached by fellow citizens is destructive of social\norder. The notion of fundamental rights, such as a right to\nprivacy as part of right to life, is not merely that the State is\nenjoined from derogating from them. It also includes the\nresponsibility of the State to uphold them against the actions\nof others in the society, even in the context of exercise of\nfundamental rights by those others.\u201d131 (emphasis supplied)\nThe Court held that while the State could access details of the bank accounts of\ncitizens as an incident of its power to investigate and prosecute crime, this would not\nenable a private citizen to compel a citizen to reveal bank accounts to the public at\nlarge.\n131 Ibid, at pages 35-36 (paras 83-84)\n77\nPART H\n78 In Sanjoy Narayan v High Court of Allahabad132, the two-judge Bench dealt\nwith a contempt petition in respect of publication of an incorrect report in a newspaper\nwhich tarnished the image of the Chief Justice of a High Court. The Court made the\nfollowing observations:\n\u201cThe unbridled power of the media can become dangerous if check\nand balance is not inherent in it. The role of the media is to\nprovide to the readers and the public in general with\ninformation and views tested and found as true and correct.\nThis power must be carefully regulated and must reconcile with\na person's fundamental right to privacy.\u201d133 (emphasis supplied)\n79 In Ramlila Maidan Incident v Home Secretary, Union of India134, Justice B\nS Chauhan in a concurring judgment held that:\n\u201cRight to privacy has been held to be a fundamental right of the\ncitizen being an integral part of Article 21 of the Constitution of India\nby this Court. Illegitimate intrusion into privacy of a person is not\npermissible as right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\nguaranteed under our Constitution. Such a right has been extended\neven to woman of easy virtues as she has been held to be entitled\nto her right of privacy. However, right of privacy may not be absolute\nand in exceptional circumstance particularly surveillance in\nconsonance with the statutory provisions may not violate such a\nright.\u201d135\nIn the view of the Court, privacy and dignity of human life have \u201calways been\nconsidered a fundamental human right of every human being\u201d like other constitutional\nvalues such as free speech. We must also take notice of the construction placed by\n132 (2011) 13 SCC 155\n133 Ibid, at page 156 (para 6)\n134 (2012) 5 SCC 1\n135 Ibid, at pages 119-120 (para 312)\n78\nPART H\nthe judgment on the decision in Kharak Singh as having \u201cheld that the right to privacy\nis a part of life under Article 21 of the Constitution\u201d and which was reiterated in PUCL.\n80 The judgment of a Bench of two judges of this Court in Bihar Public Service\nCommission v Saiyed Hussain Abbas Rizwi136 dealt with the provisions of Section\n8(1)(g) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. A person claiming to be a public-spirited\ncitizen sought information under the statute from the Bihar Public Service Commission\non a range of matters relating to interviews conducted by it on two days. The\ncommission disclosed the information save and except for the names of the interview\nboard. The High Court directed disclosure. Section 8(1)(g) provides an exemption\nfrom disclosure of information of the following nature:\n\u201cinformation, the disclosure of which would endanger the life or\nphysical safety of any person or identify the source of information\nor assistance given in confidence for law enforcement and security\npurposes.\u201d\nJustice Swatanter Kumar, speaking for the Court, held thus:\n\u201cCertain matters, particularly in relation to appointment, are\nrequired to be dealt with great confidentiality. The information may\ncome to knowledge of the authority as a result of disclosure by\nothers who give that information in confidence and with complete\nfaith, integrity and fidelity. Secrecy of such information shall be\nmaintained, thus, bringing it within the ambit of fiduciary capacity.\nSimilarly, there may be cases where the disclosure has no\nrelationship to any public activity or interest or it may even\ncause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual. All\nthese protections have to be given their due implementation as they\nspring from statutory exemptions. It is not a decision simpliciter\nbetween private interest and public interest. It is a matter\n136 (2012) 13 SCC 61\n79\nPART H\nwhere a constitutional protection is available to a person with\nregard to the right to privacy. Thus, the public interest has to be\nconstrued while keeping in mind the balance factor between right to\nprivacy and right to information with the purpose sought to be\nachieved and the purpose that would be served in the larger public\ninterest, particularly when both these rights emerge from the\nconstitutional values under the Constitution of India.\u201d137\n(emphasis supplied)\nSignificantly, though the Court was construing the text of a statutory exemption\ncontained in Section 8, it dwelt on the privacy issues involved in the disclosure of\ninformation furnished in confidence by adverting to the constitutional right to privacy.\n81 The decision Lillu @Rajesh v State of Haryana138 emphasized the right of\nrape survivors to privacy, physical and mental integrity and dignity. The Court held\nthus:\n\u201cIn view of International Covenant on Economic, Social, and\nCultural Rights 1966; United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles\nof Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power 1985, rape\nsurvivors are entitled to legal recourse that does not retraumatize\nthem or violate their physical or mental integrity and dignity. They\nare also entitled to medical procedures conducted in a manner that\nrespects their right to consent. Medical procedures should not be\ncarried out in a manner that constitutes cruel, inhuman, or\ndegrading treatment and health should be of paramount\nconsideration while dealing with gender-based violence. The\nState is under an obligation to make such services available to\nsurvivors of sexual violence. Proper measures should be\ntaken to ensure their safety and there should be no arbitrary or\nunlawful interference with his privacy.\u201d139 (emphasis supplied)\n137 Ibid, at page 74 (para 23)\n138 (2013) 14 SCC 643\n139 Ibid, at page 648 (para 13)\n80\nPART H\n82 In Thalappalam Service Cooperative Bank Limited v State of Kerala140,\nanother Bench of two judges considered the correctness of a decision of the Kerala\nHigh Court which upheld a circular issued by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies.\nBy the circular all cooperative institutions under his administrative control were\ndeclared to be public authorities within the meaning of Section 2(h) of the Right to\nInformation Act, 2005. Section 8(j) contains an exemption from the disclosure of\npersonal information which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or\nwhich would cause \u201cunwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual\u201d unless the\nauthority is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies its disclosure. This Court\nobserved that the right to privacy has been recognized as a part of Article 21 of the\nConstitution and the statutory provisions contained in Section 8(j) of the RTI Act have\nbeen enacted by the legislature in recognition of the constitutional protection of\nprivacy. The Court held thus:\n\u201cThe right to privacy is also not expressly guaranteed under the\nConstitution of India. However, the Privacy Bill, 2011 to provide for\nthe right to privacy to citizens of India and to regulate the collection,\nmaintenance and dissemination of their personal information and\nfor penalisation for violation of such rights and matters connected\ntherewith, is pending. In several judgments including Kharak\nSingh v. State of U.P .[AIR 1963 SC 1295 : (1963) 2 Cri LJ 329] , R.\nRajagopal v. State of T.N. [(1994) 6 SCC 632] , People's Union for\nCivil Liberties v. Union of India [(1997) 1 SCC 301] and State of\nMaharashtra v. Bharat Shanti Lal Shah [(2008) 13 SCC 5] this\nCourt has recognised the right to privacy as a fundamental right\nemanating from Article 21 of the Constitution of India.\u201d141\n\u201cRecognising the fact that the right to privacy is a sacrosanct facet\nof Article 21 of the Constitution, the legislation has put a lot of\n140 (2013) 16 SCC 82\n141 Ibid, at page 112 (para 57)\n81\nPART H\nsafeguards to protect the rights under Section 8(j), as already\nindicated.\u201d142\nThis Court held that on facts the cooperative societies were not public authorities and\nthe decision under challenge was quashed.\n83 In Manoj Narula v Union of India143, a Constitution Bench of this Court was\nhearing a petition filed in the public interest complaining of the increasing\ncriminalization of politics. Dealing with the provisions of Article 75(1) of the\nConstitution, Justice Dipak Misra, while explaining the doctrine of \u201cconstitutional\nimplications\u201d, considered whether the Court could read a disqualification into the\nprovisions made by the Constitution in addition to those which have been provided by\nthe legislature. In that context, the leading judgment observes:\n\u201cIn this regard, inclusion of many a facet within the ambit of Article\n21 is well established. In R. Rajagopal v. State of T.N. [(1994) 6\nSCC 632] , right to privacy has been inferred from Article 21.\nSimilarly, in Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P. [(1994) 4 SCC 260 :\n1994 SCC (Cri) 1172 : AIR 1994 SC 1349] , inherent rights under\nArticles 21 and 22 have been stated. Likewise, while dealing with\nfreedom of speech and expression and freedom of press, the Court,\nin Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras [AIR 1950 SC 124 : (1950)\n51 Cri LJ 1514] , has observed that freedom of speech and\nexpression includes freedom of propagation of ideas\u2026\nThere is no speck of doubt that the Court has applied the doctrine\nof implication to expand the constitutional concepts, but the context\nin which the horizon has been expanded has to be borne in mind\u2026\n142 Ibid, at page 114 (para 64)\n143 (2014) 9 SCC 1\n82\nPART H\nAt this juncture, it is seemly to state that the principle of implication\nis fundamentally founded on rational inference of an idea from the\nwords used in the text\u2026\nAny proposition that is arrived at taking this route of interpretation\nmust find some resting pillar or strength on the basis of certain\nwords in the text or the scheme of the text. In the absence of that,\nit may not be permissible for a court to deduce any proposition as\nthat would defeat the legitimacy of reasoning. A proposition can be\nestablished by reading a number of articles cohesively, for that will\nbe in the domain of substantive legitimacy.\u201d144 (emphasis supplied)\n84 In National Legal Services Authority v Union of India145 (\u201cNALSA\u201d), a\nBench of two judges, while dealing with the rights of transgenders, adverted to\ninternational conventions acceded to by India including the UDHR and ICCPR.\nProvisions in these conventions which confer a protection against arbitrary and\nunlawful interference with a person\u2019s privacy, family and home would, it was held, be\nread in a manner which harmonizes the fundamental rights contained in Articles 14,\n15, 19 and 21 with India\u2019s international obligations. Justice K S Radhakrishnan held\nthat:\n\u201cGender identity, therefore, lies at the core of one's personal\nidentity, gender expression and presentation and, therefore, it will\nhave to be protected under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of\nIndia. A transgender's personality could be expressed by the\ntransgender's behaviour and presentation. State cannot prohibit,\nrestrict or interfere with a transgender's expression of such\npersonality, which reflects that inherent personality. Often the State\nand its authorities either due to ignorance or otherwise fail to digest\nthe innate character and identity of such persons. We, therefore,\nhold that values of privacy, self-identity, autonomy and personal\nintegrity are fundamental rights guaranteed to members of the\ntransgender community under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of\n144 Ibid, at pages 47-48 (paras 69-70)\n145 (2014) 5 SCC 438\n83\nPART H\nIndia and the State is bound to protect and recognise those\nrights.\u201d146\nExplaining the ambit of Article 21, the Court noted:\n\u201cArticle 21 is the heart and soul of the Indian Constitution, which\nspeaks of the rights to life and personal liberty. Right to life is one\nof the basic fundamental rights and not even the State has the\nauthority to violate or take away that right. Article 21 takes all those\naspects of life which go to make a person's life meaningful. Article\n21 protects the dignity of human life, one's personal autonomy,\none's right to privacy, etc. Right to dignity has been recognised to\nbe an essential part of the right to life and accrues to all persons on\naccount of being humans. In Francis Coralie Mullin v. UT of\nDelhi[(1981) 1 SCC 608 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 212] (SCC pp. 618-19,\nparas 7 and 8), this Court held that the right to dignity forms an\nessential part of our constitutional culture which seeks to ensure the\nfull development and evolution of persons and includes \u201cexpressing\noneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and\ncomingling with fellow human beings\u2026147\nArticle 21, as already indicated, guarantees the protection of\n\u201cpersonal autonomy\u201d of an individual. In Anuj Garg v. Hotel Assn. of\nIndia [(2008) 3 SCC 1] (SCC p. 15, paras 34-35), this Court held\nthat personal autonomy includes both the negative right of not to be\nsubject to interference by others and the positive right of individuals\nto make decisions about their life, to express themselves and to\nchoose which activities to take part in. Self-determination of gender\nis an integral part of personal autonomy and self-expression and\nfalls within the realm of personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21\nof the Constitution of India.148\u201d\nDr Justice A K Sikri wrote a lucid concurring judgment.\n146 Ibid, at page 490 (para 72)\n147 Ibid, at page 490 (para 73)\n148 Ibid, at page 491 (para 75)\n84\nPART H\nNALSA indicates the rationale for grounding of a right to privacy in the protection of\ngender identity within Article 15. The intersection of Article 15 with Article 21 locates\na constitutional right to privacy as an expression of individual autonomy, dignity and\nidentity. NALSA indicates that the right to privacy does not necessarily have to fall\nwithin the ambit of any one provision in the chapter on fundamental rights. Intersecting\nrights recognise the right to privacy. Though primarily, it is in the guarantee of life and\npersonal liberty under Article 21 that a constitutional right to privacy dwells, it is\nenriched by the values incorporated in other rights which are enumerated in Part III of\nthe Constitution.\n85 In ABC v The State (NCT of Delhi)149, the Court dealt with the question\nwhether it is imperative for an unwed mother to specifically notify the putative father\nof the child of her petition for appointment as guardian of her child. It was stated by\nthe mother of the child that she does not want the future of her child to be marred by\nany controversy regarding his paternity, which would indubitably result should the\nfather refuse to acknowledge the child as his own. It was her contention that her own\nfundamental right to privacy will be violated if she is compelled to disclose the name\nand particulars of the father of her child. Looking into the interest of the child, the\nBench directed that \u201cif a single parent/unwed mother applies for the issuance of a Birth\nCertificate for a child born from her womb, the Authorities concerned may only require\n149 (2015) 10 SCC 1\n85\nPART H\nher to furnish an affidavit to this effect, and must thereupon issue the Birth Certificate,\nunless there is a Court direction to the contrary\u201d150.\n86 While considering the constitutional validity of the Constitution (Ninety-Ninth\nAmendment) Act, 2014 which enunciated an institutional process for the appointment\nof judges, the concurring judgment of Justice Madan B Lokur in Supreme Court\nAdvocates on Record Association v Union of India151 dealt with privacy issues\ninvolved if disclosures were made about a candidate under consideration for\nappointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court or High Court. Dealing with the right to\nknow of the general public on the one hand and the right to privacy on the other hand,\nJustice Lokur noted that the latter is an \u201cimplicit fundamental right that all people\nenjoy\u201d. Justice Lokur observed thus:\n\u201cThe balance between transparency and confidentiality is very\ndelicate and if some sensitive information about a particular person\nis made public, it can have a far-reaching impact on his/her\nreputation and dignity. The 99th Constitution Amendment Act and\nthe NJAC Act have not taken note of the privacy concerns of an\nindividual. This is important because it was submitted by the\nlearned Attorney General that the proceedings of NJAC will be\ncompletely transparent and any one can have access to information\nthat is available with NJAC. This is a rather sweeping\ngeneralization which obviously does not take into account the\nprivacy of a person who has been recommended for\nappointment, particularly as a Judge of the High Court or in the\nfirst instance as a Judge of the Supreme Court. The right to\nknow is not a fundamental right but at best it is an implicit\nfundamental right and it is hedged in with the implicit\nfundamental right to privacy that all people enjoy. The balance\nbetween the two implied fundamental rights is difficult to maintain,\n150 Ibid, at page 18 (para 28)\n151 (2016) 5 SCC 1\n86\nPART H\nbut the 99th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act do not\neven attempt to consider, let alone achieve that balance.\u201d152\n(emphasis supplied)\n87 A comprehensive analysis of precedent has been necessary because it\nindicates the manner in which the debate on the existence of a constitutional right to\nprivacy has progressed. The content of the constitutional right to privacy and its\nlimitations have proceeded on a case to case basis, each precedent seeking to build\nupon and follow the previous formulations. The doctrinal foundation essentially rests\nupon the trilogy of M P Sharma \u2013 Kharak Singh \u2013 Gobind upon which subsequent\ndecisions including those in Rajagopal, PUCL, Canara Bank, Selvi and NALSA have\ncontributed. Reconsideration of the doctrinal basis cannot be complete without\nevaluating what the trilogy of cases has decided.\n88 M P Sharma dealt with a challenge to a search on the ground that the statutory\nprovision which authorized it, violated the guarantee against self-incrimination in\nArticle 20(3). In the absence of a specific provision like the Fourth Amendment to the\nUS Constitution in the Indian Constitution, the Court answered the challenge by its\nruling that an individual who is subject to a search during the course of which material\nis seized does not make a voluntary testimonial statement of the nature that would\nattract Article 20(3). The Court distinguished a compulsory search from a voluntary\nstatement of disclosure in pursuance of a notice issued by an authority to produce\n152 Ibid, at page 676 (para 953)\n87\nPART H\ndocuments. It was the former category that was held to be involved in a compulsive\nsearch, which the Court held would not attract the guarantee against self-\nincrimination. The judgment, however, proceeded further to hold that in the absence\nof the right to privacy having been enumerated in the Constitution, a provision like the\nFourth Amendment to the US Constitution could not be read into our own. The\nobservation in regard to the absence of the right to privacy in our Constitution was\nstrictly speaking, not necessary for the decision of the Court in M P Sharma and the\nobservation itself is no more than a passing observation. Moreover, the decision does\nnot adjudicate upon whether privacy could be a constitutionally protected right under\nany other provision such as Article 21 or under Article 19.\n89 Kharak Singh does not contain a reference to M P Sharma. The decision of\nthe majority in Kharak Singh is essentially divided into two parts; the first dealing with\nthe validity of a regulation for nocturnal domiciliary visits (which was struck down) and\nthe second dealing with the rest of the regulation (which was upheld). The decision\non the first part, which dealt with Regulation 236(b) conveys an inescapable\nimpression that the regulation invaded the sanctity of the home and was a violation of\nordered liberty. Though the reasoning of the Court does not use the expression\n\u2018privacy\u2019, it alludes to the decision of the US Supreme Court in Wolf v Colorado, which\ndeals with privacy. Besides, the portion extracted in the judgment has a reference to\nprivacy specifically at two places. While holding domiciliary visits at night to be invalid,\nthe Court drew sustenance from the right to life under Article 21 which means\n88\nPART H\nsomething more than a mere animal existence. The right under Article 21 includes the\nenjoyment of those faculties which render the right meaningful. Hence, the first part\nof the decision in Kharak Singh represents an amalgam of life, personal liberty and\nprivacy. It protects interests which are grounded in privacy under the rubric of liberty.\nThe difficulty in construing the decision arises because in the second part of its\ndecision, the majority upheld the rest of the regulation and observed (while doing so)\nthat there is an absence of a protected right to privacy under the Constitution. These\nobservations in the second part are at variance with those dealing with the first. The\nview about the absence of a right to privacy is an isolated observation which cannot\ncoexist with the essential determination rendered on the first aspect of the regulation.\nSubsequent Benches of this Court in the last five decades and more, have attempted\nto make coherent doctrine out of the uneasy coexistence between the first and the\nsecond parts of the decision in Kharak Singh. Several of them rely on the protection\nof interests grounded in privacy in the first part, under the conceptual foundation of\nordered liberty.\n90 Gobind proceeded on the basis of an assumption and explains what according\nto the Court would be the content of the right to privacy if it is held to be a constitutional\nright. Gobind underlines that the right would be intrinsic to ordered liberty and would\ncover intimate matters such as family, marriage and procreation. Gobind, while\nrecognizing that the right would not be absolute and would be subject to the regulatory\npower of the State, conditioned the latter on the existence of a compelling state\n89\nPART H\ninterest. The decision also brings in the requirement of a narrow tailoring of the\nregulation to meet the needs of a compelling interest. The Bench which decided\nGobind adverted to the decision in Kharak Singh (though not M P Sharma). Be that\nas it may, Gobind has proceeded on the basis of an assumption that the right to\nprivacy is a constitutionally protected right in India. Subsequent decisions of this Court\nhave treated the formulation of a right to privacy as one that emerges out of Kharak\nSingh or Gobind (or both). Evidently, it is the first part of the decision in Kharak\nSingh which is construed as having recognized a constitutional entitlement to privacy\nwithout reconciling the second part which contains a specific observation on the\nabsence of a protected constitutional right to privacy in the Constitution. Succeeding\nBenches of smaller strength were not obviously in a position to determine the\ncorrectness of the M P Sharma and Kharak Singh formulations. They had to weave\na jurisprudence of privacy as new challenges emerged from a variety of sources: wire-\ntapping, narco-analysis, gender based identity, medical information, informational\nautonomy and other manifestations of privacy. As far as the decisions following upon\nGobind are concerned, it does emerge that the assumptions which find specific\nmention in several parts of the decision were perhaps not adequately placed in\nperspective. Gobind has been construed by subsequent Benches as affirming the\nright to privacy.\n91 The right to privacy has been traced in the decisions which have been rendered\nover more than four decades to the guarantee of life and personal liberty in Article 21\n90\nPART H\nand the freedoms set out in Article 19. In addition, India\u2019s commitment to a world order\nfounded on respect for human rights has been noticed along with the specific articles\nof the UDHR and the ICCPR which embody the right to privacy.153 In the view of this\nCourt, international law has to be construed as a part of domestic law in the absence\nof legislation to the contrary and, perhaps more significantly, the meaning of\nconstitutional guarantees must be illuminated by the content of international\nconventions to which India is a party. Consequently, as new cases brought new issues\nand problems before the Court, the content of the right to privacy has found\nelaboration in these diverse contexts. These would include telephone tapping (PUCL),\nprior restraints on publication of material on a death row convict (Rajagopal),\ninspection and search of confidential documents involving the banker - customer\nrelationship (Canara Bank), disclosure of HIV status (Mr X v Hospital Z), food\npreferences and animal slaughter (Hinsa Virodhak Sangh), medical termination of\npregnancy (Suchita Srivastava), scientific tests in criminal investigation (Selvi),\ndisclosure of bank accounts held overseas (Ram Jethmalani) and the right of\ntransgenders (NALSA). Early cases dealt with police regulations authorising\nintrusions on liberty, such as surveillance. As Indian society has evolved, the assertion\nof the right to privacy has been considered by this Court in varying contexts replicating\nthe choices and autonomy of the individual citizen.\n153 See Rishika Taneja and Sidhant Kumar, Privacy Law: Principles, Injunctions and Compensation, Eastern\nBook Company (2014), for a comprehensive account on the right to privacy and privacy laws in India.\n91\nPART I\n92 The deficiency, however, is in regard to a doctrinal formulation of the basis on\nwhich it can be determined as to whether the right to privacy is constitutionally\nprotected. M P Sharma need not have answered the question; Kharak Singh dealt\nwith it in a somewhat inconsistent formulation while Gobind rested on assumption. M\nP Sharma being a decision of eight judges, this Bench has been called upon to decide\non the objection of the Union of India to the existence of such a right in the first place.\nI The Indian Constitution\nPreamble\n93 The Preamble to the Constitution postulates that the people of India have\nresolved to constitute India into a Republic which (among other things) is Sovereign\nand Democratic and to secure to all its citizens:\n\u201cJUSTICE, social, economic and political;\nLIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;\nEQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among\nthem all\nFRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of\nthe Nation;\u2026\u201d\n94 In Sajjan Singh v State of Rajasthan154, Justice Mudholkar alluded to the fact\nthat the Preamble to our Constitution is \u201cnot of the common run\u201d as is the Preamble\nin a legislative enactment but was marked both by a \u201cstamp of deep deliberation\u201d and\n154 (1965) 1 SCR 933\n92\nPART I\nprecision. This was suggestive, in the words of the Court, of the special significance\nattached to the Preamble by the framers of the Constitution.\n95 In Kesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala155 (\u201cKesavananda Bharati\u201d),\nChief Justice Sikri noticed that the Preamble is a part of the Constitution. The\nPreamble emphasises the need to secure to all citizens justice, liberty, equality and\nfraternity. Together they constitute the founding faith or the blueprint of values\nembodied with a sense of permanence in the constitutional document. The Preamble\nspeaks of securing liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. Fraternity\nis to be promoted to assure the dignity of the individual. The individual lies at the core\nof constitutional focus and the ideals of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity animate\nthe vision of securing a dignified existence to the individual. The Preamble envisions\na social ordering in which fundamental constitutional values are regarded as\nindispensable to the pursuit of happiness. Such fundamental values have also found\nreflection in the foundational document of totalitarian regimes in other parts of the\nworld. What distinguishes India is the adoption of a democratic way of life, founded\non the rule of law. Democracy accepts differences of perception, acknowledges\ndivergences in ways of life, and respects dissent.\n155 (1973) 4 SCC 225\n93\nPART I\nJurisprudence on dignity\n96 Over the last four decades, our constitutional jurisprudence has recognised the\ninseparable relationship between protection of life and liberty with dignity. Dignity as\na constitutional value finds expression in the Preamble. The constitutional vision\nseeks the realisation of justice (social, economic and political); liberty (of thought,\nexpression, belief, faith and worship); equality (as a guarantee against arbitrary\ntreatment of individuals) and fraternity (which assures a life of dignity to every\nindividual). These constitutional precepts exist in unity to facilitate a humane and\ncompassionate society. The individual is the focal point of the Constitution because it\nis in the realisation of individual rights that the collective well being of the community\nis determined. Human dignity is an integral part of the Constitution. Reflections of\ndignity are found in the guarantee against arbitrariness (Article 14), the lamps of\nfreedom (Article 19) and in the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21).\n97 In Prem Shankar Shukla v Delhi Administration156, which arose from the\nhandcuffing of the prisoners, Justice Krishna Iyer, speaking for a three-judge Bench\nof this Court held:\n\u201c\u2026the guarantee of human dignity, which forms part of our\nconstitutional culture, and the positive provisions of Articles 14, 19\nand 21 spring into action when we realise that to manacle man is\nmore than to mortify him; it is to dehumanize him and, therefore, to\n156 (1980) 3 SCC 526\n94\nPART I\nviolate his very personhood, too often using the mask of\n'dangerousness' and security\u2026157\nThe Preamble sets the humane tone and temper of the Founding\nDocument and highlights Justice, Equality and the dignity of the\nindividual. 158\u201d\n98 A Bench of two judges in Francis Coralie Mullin v Union Territory of Delhi159\n(\u201cFrancis Coralie\u201d) while construing the entitlement of a detenue under the\nConservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities\n(COFEPOSA) Act, 1974 to have an interview with a lawyer and the members of his\nfamily held that:\n\u201cThe fundamental right to life which is the most precious human\nright and which forms the ark of all other rights must therefore be\ninterpreted in a broad and expansive spirit so as to invest it with\nsignificance and vitality which may endure for years to come and\nenhance the dignity of the individual and the worth of the human\nperson\u2026160\n\u2026the right to life enshrined in Article 21 cannot be restricted to mere\nanimal existence. It means something much more than just physical\nsurvival.161\n\u2026We think that the right to life includes the right to live with human\ndignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries\nof life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter and facilities\nfor reading, writing and expressing one-self in diverse forms, freely\nmoving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human\nbeings\u2026Every act which offends against or impairs human dignity\nwould constitute deprivation pro tanto of this right to live and it would\nhave to be in accordance with reasonable, fair and just procedure\n157 Ibid, at pages 529-530 (para 1)\n158 Ibid, at page 537 (para 21)\n159 (1981) 1 SCC 608\n160 Ibid, at page 618 (para 6)\n161 Ibid, at page 618 (para 7)\n95\nPART I\nestablished by law which stands the test of other fundamental\nrights\u2026162\u201d\n99 In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v Union of India163, a Bench of three judges of this\nCourt while dealing with individuals who were living in bondage observed that:\n\u201c\u2026This right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article\n21 derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of\nState Policy and particularly Clause (e) and (f) of \u201cArticle 39\nand Arts. 41 and 42 and at the least, therefore, it must\ninclude protection of the health and strength of the workers,\nmen and women, and of the tender age of children against\nabuse, opportunities and facilities for children to develop in\na healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity,\neducational facilities, just and humane conditions of work\nand maternity relief. These are the minimum requirements\nwhich must exist in order to enable a person to live with\nhuman dignity, and nor State - neither the Central\nGovernment - has the right to take any action which will\ndeprive a person of the enjoyment of these basic\nessentials.\u201d164\n100 Dealing with an allegation that activists of an organization were arrested and\nparaded throughout the town by the police and were beaten up in police custody, this\nCourt in Khedat Mazdoor Chetna Sangath v State of M P165 held that:\n\u201cIt is, therefore, absolutely essential in the interest of justice,\nhuman dignity and democracy that this Court must\nintervene; order an investigation determine the correct facts\nand take strongest possible action against the respondents\nwho are responsible for these atrocities\u2026166\n162 Ibid, at pages 618-619 (para 8)\n163 (1984) 3 SCC 161\n164 Ibid, at page 183 (para 10)\n165 (1994) 6 SCC 260\n166 Ibid, at pages 262-263 (para 10)\n96\nPART I\nIf dignity or honor vanishes what remains of life. 167\u201d\n101 Human dignity was construed in M Nagaraj v Union of India168 by a\nConstitution Bench of this Court to be intrinsic to and inseparable from human\nexistence. Dignity, the Court held, is not something which is conferred and which can\nbe taken away, because it is inalienable:\n\u201cThe rights, liberties and freedoms of the individual are not\nonly to be protected against the State, they should be\nfacilitated by it\u2026 It is the duty of the State not only to\nprotect the human dignity but to facilitate it by taking\npositive steps in that direction. No exact definition of\nhuman dignity exists. It refers to the intrinsic value of\nevery human being, which is to be respected. It cannot\nbe taken away. It cannot give. It simply is. Every human\nbeing has dignity by virtue of his existence\u2026169\nIndia is constituted into a sovereign, democratic republic to\nsecure to all its citizens, fraternity assuring the dignity of the\nindividual and the unity of the nation. The sovereign,\ndemocratic republic exists to promote fraternity and the\ndignity of the individual citizen and to secure to the citizens\ncertain rights. This is because the objectives of the State\ncan be realized only in and through the individuals.\nTherefore, rights conferred on citizens and non-citizens are\nnot merely individual or personal rights. They have a large\nsocial and political content, because the objectives of the\nConstitution cannot be otherwise realized.170\u201d (emphasis\nsupplied)\n167 Ibid, at pages 271 (para 37)\n168 (2006) 8 SCC 212\n169 Ibid, at page 243-244 (para 26)\n170 Ibid, at pages 247-248 (para 42)\n97\nPART I\n102 In Maharashtra University of Health Sciences v Satchikitsa Prasarak\nMandal171, this Court held that the dignity of the individual is a core constitutional\nconcept. In Selvi, this Court recognised that:\n\u201c\u2026we must recognize that a forcible intrusion into a person's\nmental processes is also an affront to human dignity and\nliberty, often with grave and long-lasting\nconsequences\u2026\u201d172\n103 In Dr Mehmood Nayyar Azam v State of Chhattisgarh173, this Court noted\nthat when dignity is lost, life goes into oblivion. The same emphasis on dignity finds\nexpression in the decision in NALSA.\n104 The same principle was more recently reiterated in Shabnam v Union of\nIndia174 in the following terms:\n\u201cThis right to human dignity has many elements. First and foremost,\nhuman dignity is the dignity of each human being \u2018as a human\nbeing\u2019. Another element, which needs to be highlighted, in the\ncontext of the present case, is that human dignity is infringed if a\nperson\u2019s life, physical or mental welfare is alarmed. It is in this\nsense torture, humiliation, forced labour, etc. all infringe on human\ndignity. It is in this context many rights of the accused derive from\nhis dignity as a human being.\u201d175\n171 (2010) 3 SCC 786\n172 Ibid, at page 376 (para 244)\n173 (2012) 8 SCC 1\n174 (2015) 6 SCC 702\n175 Ibid, at page 713 (para 14)\n98\nPART I\n105 The recent decision in Jeeja Ghosh v Union of India176 construed the\nconstitutional protection afforded to human dignity. The Court observed:\n\u201c\u2026human dignity is a constitutional value and a constitutional goal.\nWhat are the dimensions of constitutional value of human dignity?\nIt is beautifully illustrated by Aharon Barak177 (former Chief Justice\nof the Supreme Court of Israel) in the following manner:\n\u201cThe constitutional value of human dignity has a\ncentral normative role. Human dignity as a\nconstitutional value is the factor that unites the human\nrights into one whole. It ensures the normative unity of\nhuman rights. This normative unity is expressed in the\nthree ways: first, the value of human dignity serves as\na normative basis for constitutional rights set out in the\nconstitution; second, it serves as an interpretative\nprinciple for determining the scope of constitutional\nrights, including the right to human dignity; third, the\nvalue of human dignity has an important role in\ndetermining the proportionality of a statute limiting a\nconstitutional right.\u201d178\n106 Life is precious in itself. But life is worth living because of the freedoms which\nenable each individual to live life as it should be lived. The best decisions on how life\nshould be lived are entrusted to the individual. They are continuously shaped by the\nsocial milieu in which individuals exist. The duty of the state is to safeguard the ability\nto take decisions \u2013 the autonomy of the individual \u2013 and not to dictate those decisions.\n\u2018Life\u2019 within the meaning of Article 21 is not confined to the integrity of the physical\n176 (2016) 7 SCC 761\n177 Aharon Barak, Human Dignity- The Constitutional Value and the Constitutional Right, Cambridge University\nPress (2015)\n178 Supra Note 176, at page 792 (para 37)\n99\nPART I\nbody. The right comprehends one\u2019s being in its fullest sense. That which facilitates\nthe fulfilment of life is as much within the protection of the guarantee of life.\n107 To live is to live with dignity. The draftsmen of the Constitution defined their\nvision of the society in which constitutional values would be attained by emphasising,\namong other freedoms, liberty and dignity. So fundamental is dignity that it permeates\nthe core of the rights guaranteed to the individual by Part III. Dignity is the core which\nunites the fundamental rights because the fundamental rights seek to achieve for each\nindividual the dignity of existence. Privacy with its attendant values assures dignity to\nthe individual and it is only when life can be enjoyed with dignity can liberty be of true\nsubstance. Privacy ensures the fulfilment of dignity and is a core value which the\nprotection of life and liberty is intended to achieve.\nFundamental Rights cases\n108 In Golak Nath v State of Punjab179, there was a challenge to the Punjab\nSecurity of Land Tenures Act, 1953 and to the Mysore Land Reforms Act (as\namended) upon their inclusion in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution.\nChief Justice Subba Rao dwelt on the rule of law and its purpose in ensuring that\nevery authority constituted by the Constitution is subject to it and functions within its\n179 (1967) 2 SCR 762\n100\nPART I\nparameters. One of the purposes of constraining governmental power was to shield\nthe fundamental freedoms against legislative majorities. This thought is reflected in\nthe following extract from the judgment of Chief Justice Subba Rao:\n\u201c\u2026But, having regard to the past history of our country, it could not\nimplicitly believe the representatives of the people, for uncontrolled\nand unrestricted power might lead to an authoritarian State. It,\ntherefore, preserves the natural rights against the State\nencroachment and constitutes the higher judiciary of the State\nas the sentinel of the said rights and the balancing wheel\nbetween the rights, subject to social control. In short, the\nfundamental rights, subject to social control, have been\nincorporated in the rule of law\u2026\u201d180 (emphasis supplied)\nThe learned Judge emphasised the position of the fundamental rights thus:\n\u201c\u2026They are the rights of the people preserved by our Constitution.\n\u201cFundamental Rights\u201d are the modern name for what have\nbeen traditionally known as \u201cnatural rights\u201d. As one author\nputs: \u201cthey are moral rights which every human being everywhere\nall times ought to have simply because of the fact that in\ncontradistinction with other things is rational and moral\u201d. They are\nthe primordial rights necessary for the development of human\npersonality. They are the rights which enable a man to chalk out of\nhis own life in the manner he likes best\u2026\u201d181 (emphasis supplied)\nThe fundamental rights, in other words, are primordial rights which have traditionally\nbeen regarded as natural rights. In that character these rights are inseparable from\nhuman existence. They have been preserved by the Constitution, this being a\nrecognition of their existence even prior to the constitutional document.\n180 Ibid, at page 788\n181 Ibid, at page 789\n101\nPART I\n109 In Kesavananda Bharati, a Bench of 13 judges considered the nature of the\namending power conferred by Article 368 and whether the exercise of the amending\npower was subject to limitations in its curtailment of the fundamental freedoms. Chief\nJustice Sikri held that the fundamental rights are inalienable. In his view, the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights had to be utilised to interpret the Constitution having\nregard to the mandate of Article 51. India, having acceded to the Universal\nDeclaration, Sikri, C.J. held that the treatment of rights as inalienable must guide the\ninterpretation of the Court. The Chief Justice relied upon a line of precedent holding\nthese rights to be natural and inalienable and observed:\n\u201c300. Various decisions of this Court describe fundamental rights\nas \u2018natural rights\u2019 or \u2018human rights\u2019. Some of these decisions are\nextracted below:\n\u201cThere can be no doubt that the people of India have in exercise of\ntheir sovereign will as expressed in the Preamble, adopted the\ndemocratic ideal, which assures to the citizen the dignity of the\nindividual and other cherished human values as a means to the full\nevolution and expression of his personality, and in delegating to the\nlegislature, the executive and the judiciary their respective powers\nin the Constitution, reserved to themselves certain fundamental\nrights so-called, I apprehend because they have been retained by\nthe people and made paramount to the delegated powers, as in the\nAmerican Model.

This is true. But this does not place every provision of\nthe Constitution in the same position. The true position is that every\nprovision of the Constitution can be amended provided in the result\nthe basic foundation and structure of the Constitution remains the\nsame. The basic structure may be said to consist of the following\nfeatures:\n(1) Supremacy of the Constitution;\n(2) Republican and Democratic form of Government;\n(3) Secular character of the Constitution;\n(4) Separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and\nthe judiciary;\n(5) Federal character of the Constitution.\u201d183\nJustices Shelat and Grover held that \u201c[t]he dignity of the individual secured by the\nvarious freedoms and basic rights in Part III and the mandate to build a welfare State\ncontained in Part IV\u201d184 constituted a part of the basic structure.\nJustices Hegde and Mukherjea emphasised that the primary object before the\nConstituent Assembly were: (i) to constitute India into a sovereign, democratic\nrepublic and (ii) to secure its citizens the rights mentioned in it. Hence, the learned\nJudges found it impossible to accept that the Constitution makers would have made\na provision in the Constitution itself for the destruction of the very ideals which they\nhad embodied in the fundamental rights. Hence, Parliament had no power to abrogate\nthe fundamental features of the Constitution including among them \u201cthe essential\nfeatures of the individual freedoms secured to the citizens\u201d.\n\u201cOn a careful consideration of the various aspects of the case, we\nare convinced that the Parliament has no power to abrogate or\n183 Ibid, at page 366 (para 292)\n184 Ibid, at page 454 (para 582)\n104\nPART I\nemasculate the basic elements or fundamental features of the\nConstitution such as the sovereignty of India, the democratic\ncharacter of our polity, the unity of the country, the essential\nfeatures of the individual freedoms secured to the citizens. Nor\nhas the Parliament the power to revoke the mandate to build a\nwelfare State and egalitarian society. These limitations are only\nillustrative and not exhaustive. Despite these limitations, however,\nthere can be no question that the amending power is a wide power\nand it reaches every Article and every part of the Constitution. That\npower can be used to reshape the Constitution to fulfil the obligation\nimposed on the State. It can also be used to reshape the\nConstitution within the limits mentioned earlier, to make it an\neffective instrument for social good. We are unable to agree with\nthe contention that in order to build a welfare State, it is\nnecessary to destroy some of the human freedoms. That, at\nany rate is not the perspective of our Constitution. Our\nConstitution envisages that the State should without delay\nmake available to all the citizens of this country the real\nbenefits of those freedoms in a democratic way. Human\nfreedoms are lost gradually and imperceptibly and their destruction\nis generally followed by authoritarian rule. That is what history has\ntaught us. Struggle between liberty and power is eternal. Vigilance\nis the price that we like every other democratic society have to pay\nto safeguard the democratic values enshrined in our Constitution.\nEven the best of Governments are not averse to have more and\nmore power to carry out their plans and programmes which they\nmay sincerely believe to be in public interest. But a freedom once\nlost is hardly ever regained except by revolution. Every\nencroachment on freedom sets a pattern for further encroachments.\nOur constitutional plan is to eradicate poverty without\ndestruction of individual freedoms.\u201d185 (emphasis supplied)\nJustice Jaganmohan Reddy held that:\n\u201c\u2026Parliament cannot under Article 368 expand its power of\namendment so as to confer on itself the power to repeal, abrogate\nthe Constitution or damage, emasculate or destroy any of the\nfundamental rights or essential elements of the basic structure of\nthe Constitution or of destroying the identity of the Constitution\u2026\u201d186\n185 Ibid, at pages 486-487 (para 666)\n186 Ibid, at page 666 (para 1212)\n105\nPART I\nJustice Khanna in the course of the summation of his conclusions held, as regards\nthe power of amendment, that:\n\u201cThe power of amendment under Article 368 does not include the\npower to abrogate the Constitution nor does it include the power to\nalter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution. Subject to\nthe retention of the basic structure or framework of the Constitution,\nthe power of amendment is plenary and includes within itself the\npower to amend the various articles of the Constitution, including\nthose relating to fundamental rights as well as those which may be\nsaid to relate to essential features. No part of a fundamental right\ncan claim immunity from amendatory process by being described\nas the essence, or core of that right. The power of amendment\nwould also include within itself the power to add, alter or repeal the\nvarious articles.\u201d187\nSignificantly, even though Justice Mathew was in the minority, the learned Judge in\nthe course of his decision observed the importance of human dignity:\n\u201cThe social nature of man, the generic traits of his physical and\nmental constitution, his sentiments of justice and the morals within,\nhis instinct for individual and collective preservations, his desire for\nhappiness, his sense of human dignity, his consciousness of man\u2019s\nstation and purpose in life, all these are not products of fancy but\nobjective factors in the realm of existence\u2026\u201d188\n110 In Indira Nehru Gandhi v Raj Narain189, Justice Khanna clarified that his view\nin Kesavananda Bharati is that Parliament in the exercise of its power to amend the\nConstitution cannot destroy or abrogate the basic structure of the Constitution. No\ndistinction was made in regard to the scope of the amending power relating to the\n187 Ibid, at page 824 (para 1537(vii))\n188 Ibid, at pages 866-867 (para 1676)\n189 (1975) 1 Suppl. SCC 1\n106\nPART I\nprovisions of the fundamental rights and in respect of matters other than the\nfundamental rights:\n\u201c\u2026The limitation inherent in the word \u201camendment\u201d according to\nwhich it is not permissible by amendment of the Constitution to\nchange the basic structure of the Constitution was to operate\nequally on articles pertaining to fundamental rights as on other\narticles not pertaining to those rights\u2026\u201d190\nJustice Khanna noted that the right to property was held by him not to be a part of the\nbasic structure. Justice Khanna observed that it would have been unnecessary for\nhim to hold so, if none of the fundamental rights were to be a part of the basic structure\nof the Constitution.\n111 Chandrachud C J, in the course of his judgment for the Constitution Bench in\nMinerva Mills Ltd v Union of India191, traced the history of the evolution of inalienable\nrights, founded in inviolable liberties, during the course of the freedom movement and\nobserved that both Parts III and IV of the Constitution had emerged as inseparably\ninter-twined, without a distinction between the negative and positive obligations of the\nstate.\nThe Constitution, in this view, is founded on \u201cthe bedrock of the balance between\nParts III and IV\u201d and to give absolute primacy to one over the other would be to disturb\nthe harmony of the Constitution. In the view of the Chief Justice:\n190 Ibid, at page 115 (para 251)\n191 (1980) 3 SCC 625\n107\nPART I\n\u201cThe edifice of our Constitution is built upon the concepts\ncrystallised in the Preamble. We resolved to constitute ourselves\ninto a Socialist State which carried with it the obligation to secure to\nour people justice \u2013 social, economic and political. We, therefore,\nput Part IV into our Constitution containing directive principles of\nState policy which specify the socialistic goal to be achieved. We\npromised to our people a democratic polity which carries with it the\nobligation of securing to the people liberty of thought, expression,\nbelief, faith and worship; equality of status and of opportunity and\nthe assurance that the dignity of the individual will at all costs be\npreserved. We, therefore, put Part III in our Constitution conferring\nthose rights on the people\u2026\u201d192\nArticles 14 and 19, the Court held, confer rights essential for the proper functioning of\na democracy and are universally so regarded by the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. Withdrawing the protection of Articles 14 and 19 was plainly impermissible\nand the immunity granted by the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution to a law against\nthe challenge that it violates Articles 14 or 19 (if the law is for giving effect to the\nDirective Principles) amounted to a violation of the basic structure.\nNo waiver of Fundamental Rights\n112 In Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v The State of Bombay193, Chief Justice\nMahajan, speaking for the Constitution Bench, noted the link between the\nconstitutional vision contained in the Preamble and the position of the fundamental\nrights as a means to facilitate its fulfilment. Though Part III embodies fundamental\nrights, this was construed to be part of the wider notion of securing the vision of justice\n192 Ibid, at page 654 (para 57)\n193 (1955) 1 SCR 613\n108\nPART I\nof the founding fathers and, as a matter of doctrine, the rights guaranteed were held\nnot to be capable of being waived. Mahajan, CJ, observed:\n\u201cWe think that the rights described as fundamental rights are a\nnecessary consequence of the declaration in the Preamble that the\npeople of India have solemnly resolved to constitute India into a\nsovereign democratic republic and to secure to all its citizens\njustice, social, economic and political; liberty of thought, expression,\nbelief, faith and worship; equality of status and of opportunity.\nThese fundamental rights have not been put in the Constitution\nmerely for individual benefit, though ultimately they come into\noperation in considering individual rights. They have been put there\nas a matter of public policy and the doctrine of waiver can have no\napplication to provisions of law which have been enacted as a\nmatter of constitutional policy.\u201d194\nPrivacy as intrinsic to freedom and liberty\n113 The submission that recognising the right to privacy is an exercise which would\nrequire a constitutional amendment and cannot be a matter of judicial interpretation is\nnot an acceptable doctrinal position. The argument assumes that the right to privacy\nis independent of the liberties guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. There lies\nthe error. The right to privacy is an element of human dignity. The sanctity of privacy\nlies in its functional relationship with dignity. Privacy ensures that a human being can\nlead a life of dignity by securing the inner recesses of the human personality from\nunwanted intrusion. Privacy recognises the autonomy of the individual and the right\nof every person to make essential choices which affect the course of life. In doing so\nprivacy recognises that living a life of dignity is essential for a human being to fulfil the\n194 Ibid, at pages 653-654\n109\nPART I\nliberties and freedoms which are the cornerstone of the Constitution. To recognise the\nvalue of privacy as a constitutional entitlement and interest is not to fashion a new\nfundamental right by a process of amendment through judicial fiat. Neither are the\njudges nor is the process of judicial review entrusted with the constitutional\nresponsibility to amend the Constitution. But judicial review certainly has the task\nbefore it of determining the nature and extent of the freedoms available to each person\nunder the fabric of those constitutional guarantees which are protected. Courts have\ntraditionally discharged that function and in the context of Article 21 itself, as we have\nalready noted, a panoply of protections governing different facets of a dignified\nexistence has been held to fall within the protection of Article 21.\n114 In Olga Tellis v Bombay Municipal Corporation195, Chandrachud C J, while\nexplaining the ambit of Article 21 found a rationale for protecting the right to livelihood\nas an incident of the right to life. For, as the Court held, deprivation of livelihood would\nresult in the abrogation of the right to life:\n\u201c148. The sweep of the right to life conferred by Article 21 is wide\nand far-reaching. It does not mean merely that life cannot be\nextinguished or taken away as, for example, by the imposition and\nexecution of the death sentence, except according to procedure\nestablished by law. That is but one aspect of the right to life. An\nequally important facet of that right is the right to livelihood because,\nno person can live without the means of living, that is, the means of\nlivelihood. If the right to livelihood is not treated as a part of the\nconstitutional right to life, the easiest way of depriving a person of\nhis right to life would be to deprive him of his means of livelihood to\nthe point of abrogation. Such deprivation would not only denude the\n195 (1985) 3 SCC 545\n110\nPART I\nlife of its effective content and meaningfulness but it would make\nlife impossible to live. And yet, such deprivation would not have to\nbe in accordance with the procedure established by law, if the right\nto livelihood is not regarded as a part of the right to life. That, which\nalone makes it possible to live, leave aside what makes life liveable,\nmust be deemed to be an integral component of the right to life.\nDeprive a person of his right to livelihood and you shall have\ndeprived him of his life\u2026\u201d196\n115 In Unnikrishnan v State of Andhra Pradesh197, Justice Jeevan Reddy,\nspeaking for this Court, held that though the right to education (as the Constitution\nthen stood) was not \u201cstated expressly as a fundamental right\u201d in Part III, that would\nnot militate against its being protected under the rubric of life under Article 21. These\ndecisions have been ultimately guided by the object of a Constitutional Court which\nmust be to expand the boundaries of fundamental human freedoms rather than to\nattenuate their content through a constricted judicial interpretation In Maneka, it has\nbeen stated that:\n\u201cThe attempt of the court should be to expand the reach and ambit\nof the fundamental rights rather than attenuate their meaning and\ncontent by process of judicial construction\u2026\n\u201cpersonal liberty\u201d in Article 21 is of the widest amplitude.\u201d198\n116 Now, would this Court in interpreting the Constitution freeze the content of\nconstitutional guarantees and provisions to what the founding fathers perceived? The\nConstitution was drafted and adopted in a historical context. The vision of the\nfounding fathers was enriched by the histories of suffering of those who suffered\n196 Ibid, at page 572 (para 32)\n197 (1993) 1 SCC 645\n198 Maneka (Supra note 5), at page 280 (para 5)\n111\nPART I\noppression and a violation of dignity both here and elsewhere. Yet, it would be difficult\nto dispute that many of the problems which contemporary societies face would not\nhave been present to the minds of the most perspicacious draftsmen. No generation,\nincluding the present, can have a monopoly over solutions or the confidence in its\nability to foresee the future. As society evolves, so must constitutional doctrine. The\ninstitutions which the Constitution has created must adapt flexibly to meet the\nchallenges in a rapidly growing knowledge economy. Above all, constitutional\ninterpretation is but a process in achieving justice, liberty and dignity to every citizen.\n117 Undoubtedly, there have been aberrations. In the evolution of the doctrine in\nIndia, which places the dignity of the individual and freedoms and liberties at the\nforefront, there have been a few discordant notes. Two of them need attention.\nDiscordant Notes\n(i) ADM Jabalpur\n118 In ADM Jabalpur v Shivakant Shukla199 (\u201cADM Jabalpur\u201d), the issue before\nthis Court was whether an order issued by the President under Article 359(1) of the\nConstitution suspends the right of every person to move any Court for the enforcement\nof the right to personal liberty under Article 21 upon being detained under a law\nproviding for preventive detention. The submission of the detenues in this Court was\n199 (1976) 2 SCC 521\n112\nPART I\nthat the suspension of the remedy to enforce Article 21 does not automatically entail\nsuspension of the right or the rule of law and that even during an emergency the rule\nof law could not be suspended. A majority of four judges of this Court (Justice H R\nKhanna dissenting) held that:\n\u201cLiberty is confined and controlled by law, whether common law or\nstatute. It is in the words of Burke a regulated freedom. It is not an\nabstract or absolute freedom. The safeguard of liberty is in the good\nsense of the people and in the system of representative and\nresponsible government which has been evolved. If extraordinary\npowers are given, they are given because the emergency is\nextraordinary, and are limited to the period of the emergency.\u201d200\nDealing with the issue as to whether Article 21 is the sole repository of the right to life,\nRay C J, observed that where any right which existed before the commencement of\nthe Constitution has been incorporated in Part III, the common law right would not\nexist under the Constitution. In a concurring judgment Justice Beg held that while\nadopting the Constitution, there was a notional surrender by the people of India of the\ncontrol over these rights to a sovereign republic and it is only the Constitution which\nis supreme and which can confer rights and powers. There was, in this view, a notional\nsurrender of individual freedom. Justice Beg held that:\n\u201cThe whole object of guaranteed fundamental rights is to make\nthose basic aspects of human freedom, embodied in fundamental\nrights, more secure than others not so selected. In thus recognising\nand declaring certain basic aspects of rights as fundamental by the\nConstitution of the country, the purpose was to protect them against\nundue encroachments upon them by the legislative, or executive,\nand, sometimes even judicial (e.g. Article 20) organs of the State.\nThe encroachment must remain within permissible limits and must\n200 Ibid, at page 571 (para 33)\n113\nPART I\ntake place only in prescribed modes. The intention could never\nbe to preserve something concurrently in the field of natural\nlaw or common law. It was to exclude all other control or to\nmake the Constitution the sole repository of ultimate control\nover those aspects of human freedom which were guaranteed\nthere.\u201d201 (emphasis supplied)\nA similar position was adopted by Justice Chandrachud:\n\u201cThe right to personal liberty has no hallmark and therefore\nwhen the right is put in action it is impossible to identify\nwhether the right is one given by the Constitution or is one\nwhich existed in the pre-Constitution era. If the argument of the\nrespondents is correct, no action to enforce the right to personal\nliberty can at all fall within the mischief of the Presidential Order\neven if it mentions Articles 19, 20, 21 and 22 because, every\npreliminary objection by the Government to a petition to enforce the\nright to personal liberty can be effectively answered by contending\nthat what is being enforced is either the natural right to personal\nliberty or generally, the pre-Constitution right to personal liberty.\nThe error of the respondents argument lies in its assumption,\nand in regard to the argument of some of the counsel in its\nmajor articulate premise, that the qualitative content of the\nnon-constitutional or pre-constitutional right to personal\nliberty is different from the content of the right to personal\nliberty conferred by Part III of the Constitution\u2026\u201d202\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn his view:\n\u201cIt therefore does not make any difference whether any right to\npersonal liberty was in existence prior to the enactment of the\nConstitution, either by way of a natural right, statutory right,\ncommon law right or a right available under the law of torts.\nWhatever may be the source of the right and whatever may be its\njurisdiction, the right in essence and substance is the right to\npersonal liberty. That right having been included in Part III, its\n201 Ibid, at page 604 (para 183)\n202 Ibid, at page 664 (para 379)\n114\nPART I\nenforcement will stand suspended if it is mentioned in the\nPresidential Order issued under Article 359(1).\u201d203\nJustice Bhagwati held as follows:\n\u201cNow, to my mind, it is clear that when this principle of rule of law\nthat the Executive cannot deprive a person of his liberty except by\nauthority of law, is recognised and embodied as a fundamental right\nand enacted as such in Article 21, it is difficult to comprehend how\nit could continue to have a distinct and separate existence,\nindependently and apart from this article in which it has been given\nconstitutional vesture. I fail to see how it could continue in force\nunder Article 372 when it is expressly recognised and embodied as\na fundamental right in Article 21 and finds a place in the express\nprovisions of the Constitution. Once this principle is recognised\nand incorporated in the Constitution and forms part of it, it\ncould not have any separate existence apart from the\nConstitution, unless it were also enacted as a statutory\nprinciple by some positive law of the State\u2026\u201d204 (emphasis\nsupplied)\nIn his view, it is the Constitution which is supreme and if it ordains that a person who\nis detained otherwise than in accordance with law would not be entitled to enforce the\nright of personal liberty, the Court was duty bound to give effect to it:\n\u201c\u2026it cannot be overlooked that, in the ultimate analysis, the\nprotection of personal liberty and the supremacy of law which\nsustains it must be governed by the Constitution itself. The\nConstitution is the paramount and supreme law of the land and if it\nsays that even if a person is detained otherwise than in accordance\nwith the law. he shall not be entitled to enforce his right of personal\nliberty, whilst a Presidential Order under Article 359, clause (1)\nspecifying Article 21 is in force, I have to give effect to it. Sitting as\nI do, as a Judge under the Constitution, I cannot ignore the plain\nand emphatic command of the Constitution for what I may consider\nto be necessary to meet the ends of justice. It is said that law has\n203 Ibid, at page 666 (para 383)\n204 Ibid, at page 701 (para 459)\n115\nPART I\nthe feminine capacity to tempt each devotee to find his own image\nin her bosom. No one escapes entirely. Some yield blindly, some\nwith sophistication. Only a few more or less effectively resist. I have\nalways leaned in favour of upholding personal liberty, for, I believe,\nit is one of the most cherished values of mankind. Without it life\nwould not be worth living. It is one of the pillars of free democratic\nsociety. Men have readily laid down their lives at its altar, in order\nto secure it, protect it and preserve it. But I do not think it would be\nright for me to allow my love of personal liberty to cloud my vision\nor to persuade me to place on the relevant provision of the\nConstitution a construction which its language cannot reasonably\nbear. I cannot assume to myself the role of Plato's \u201cPhilosopher\nKing\u201d in order to render what I consider ideal justice between the\ncitizen and the State. After all, the Constitution is the law of all laws\nand there alone judicial conscience must find its ultimate support\nand its final resting place. It is in this spirit of humility and obedience\nto the Constitution and driven by judicial compulsion, that I have\ncome to the conclusion that the Presidential Order dated June 27,\n1975 bars maintainability of a writ petition for habeas corpus where\nan order of detention is challenged on the ground that it is mala fide\nor not under the Act or not in compliance with it.\u201d205\nIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Khanna emphatically held that the suspension of the\nright to move any Court for the enforcement of the right under Article 21, upon a\nproclamation of emergency, would not affect the enforcement of the basic right to life\nand liberty. The Constitution was not the sole repository of the right to life and liberty:\n\u201cI am of the opinion that Article 21 cannot be considered to be the\nsole repository of the right to life and personal liberty. The right to\nlife and personal liberty is the most precious right of human beings\nin civilised societies governed by the rule of law. Many modern\nConstitutions incorporate certain fundamental rights, including the\none relating to personal freedom. According to Blackstone, the\nabsolute rights of Englishmen were the rights of personal security,\npersonal liberty and private property. The American Declaration of\nIndependence (1776) states that all men are created equal, and\n205 Ibid, at pages 723-724 (para 487)\n116\nPART I\namong their inalienable rights are life, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness\u2026\u201d206\nEven in the absence of Article 21, it would not have been permissible for the State to\ndeprive a person of his life and liberty without the authority of the law:\n\u201cEven in the absence of Article 21 in the Constitution, the State has\ngot no power to deprive a person of his life or liberty without the\nauthority of law. This is the essential postulate and basic\nassumption of the rule of law and not of men in all civilised nations.\nWithout such sanctity of life and liberty, the distinction between a\nlawless society and one governed by laws would cease to have any\nmeaning. The principle that no one shall be deprived of his life or\nliberty without the authority of law is rooted in the consideration that\nlife and liberty are priceless possessions which cannot be made the\nplaything of individual whim and caprice and that any act which has\nthe effect of tampering with life and liberty must receive sustenance\nfrom and sanction of the laws of the land. Article 21 incorporates an\nessential aspect of that principle and makes it part of the\nfundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution. It does\nnot, however, follow from the above that if Article 21 had not been\ndrafted and inserted in Part III, in that event it would have been\npermissible for the State to deprive a person of his life or liberty\nwithout the authority of law. No case has been cited before us to\nshow that before the coming into force of the Constitution or in\ncountries under rule of law where there is no provision\ncorresponding to Article 21, a claim was ever sustained by the\ncourts that the State can deprive a person of his life or liberty without\nthe authority of law\u2026\u201d207\nThe remedy for the enforcement of the right to life or liberty would not stand\nsuspended even if the right to enforce Article 21 is suspended:\n\u201cRecognition as fundamental right of one aspect of the pre-\nconstitutional right cannot have the effect of making things less\nfavourable so far as the sanctity of life and personal liberty is\n206 Ibid, at page 747 (para 525)\n207 Ibid, at pages 749-750 (para 530)\n117\nPART I\nconcerned compared to the position if an aspect of such right had\nnot been recognised as fundamental right because of the\nvulnerability of fundamental rights accruing from Article 359\u2026\u201d208\nJustice Khanna held that while wide powers to order preventive detention are vested\nin the State, there is no antithesis between the power to detain and power of the Court\nto examine the legality of such a detention:\n\u201cThe impact upon the individual of the massive and comprehensive\npowers of preventive detention with which the administrative\nofficers are armed has to be cushioned with legal safeguards\nagainst arbitrary deprivation of personal liberty if the premises of\nthe rule of law is not to lose its content and become\nmeaningless\u2026\u201d209\n119 The judgments rendered by all the four judges constituting the majority in ADM\nJabalpur are seriously flawed. Life and personal liberty are inalienable to human\nexistence. These rights are, as recognised in Kesavananda Bharati, primordial\nrights. They constitute rights under natural law. The human element in the life of the\nindividual is integrally founded on the sanctity of life. Dignity is associated with liberty\nand freedom. No civilized state can contemplate an encroachment upon life and\npersonal liberty without the authority of law. Neither life nor liberty are bounties\nconferred by the state nor does the Constitution create these rights. The right to life\nhas existed even before the advent of the Constitution. In recognising the right, the\nConstitution does not become the sole repository of the right. It would be\npreposterous to suggest that a democratic Constitution without a Bill of Rights would\nleave individuals governed by the state without either the existence of the right to live\n208 Ibid, at page 751 (para 531)\n209 Ibid, page 767 (para 574)\n118\nPART I\nor the means of enforcement of the right. The right to life being inalienable to each\nindividual, it existed prior to the Constitution and continued in force under Article 372\nof the Constitution. Justice Khanna was clearly right in holding that the recognition of\nthe right to life and personal liberty under the Constitution does not denude the\nexistence of that right, apart from it nor can there be a fatuous assumption that in\nadopting the Constitution the people of India surrendered the most precious aspect of\nthe human persona, namely, life, liberty and freedom to the state on whose mercy\nthese rights would depend. Such a construct is contrary to the basic foundation of the\nrule of law which imposes restraints upon the powers vested in the modern state when\nit deals with the liberties of the individual. The power of the Court to issue a Writ of\nHabeas Corpus is a precious and undeniable feature of the rule of law.\n120 A constitutional democracy can survive when citizens have an undiluted\nassurance that the rule of law will protect their rights and liberties against any invasion\nby the state and that judicial remedies would be available to ask searching questions\nand expect answers when a citizen has been deprived of these, most precious rights.\nThe view taken by Justice Khanna must be accepted, and accepted in reverence for\nthe strength of its thoughts and the courage of its convictions.\n121 When histories of nations are written and critiqued, there are judicial decisions\nat the forefront of liberty. Yet others have to be consigned to the archives, reflective\n119\nPART I\nof what was, but should never have been. The decision of the US Supreme Court in\nBuck v Bell210 ranks amongst the latter. It was a decision in which Justice Oliver\nWendell Holmes Jr. accepted the forcible sterilization by tubular ligation of Carrie\nBucks as part of a programme of state sponsored eugenic sterilization. Justice\nHolmes, while upholding the programme opined that: \u201cthree generations of imbeciles\nis enough\u201d211. In the same vein was the decision of the US Supreme Court in\nKorematsu v United States212, upholding the imprisonment of a citizen in a\nconcentration camp solely because of his Japanese ancestry.\nADM Jabalpur must be and is accordingly overruled. We also overrule the decision\nin Union of India v Bhanudas Krishna Gawde213, which followed ADM Jabalpur.\n122 In I R Coelho v State of Tamil Nadu214, this Court took the view that ADM\nJabalpur has been impliedly overruled by various subsequent decisions:\n\u201cDuring Emergency, the fundamental rights were read even more\nrestrictively as interpreted by the majority in ADM, Jabalpur v.\nShivakant Shukla [(1976) 2 SCC 521]. The decision in ADM,\nJabalpur [(1976) 2 SCC 521] about the restrictive reading of right to\nlife and liberty stood impliedly overruled by various subsequent\ndecisions.\u201d215\n210 274 US 200 (1927)\n211 A moving account of the times and the position is to be found in Siddhartha Mukherjee, The Gene: An Intimate\nHistory, Penguin Books Ltd.

The Delhi High Court, however, clarified that Section 377 will continue\nto govern non-consensual penile, non-vaginal sex and penile non-vaginal sex\ninvolving minors. Among the grounds of challenge was that the statutory provision\nconstituted an infringement of the rights to dignity and privacy. The Delhi High Court\nheld that:\n\u201c\u2026The sphere of privacy allows persons to develop human\nrelations without interference from the outside community or from\n216 (2014) 1 SCC 1\n217 Naz Foundation v Government of NCT, 2010 Cri LJ 94\n121\nPART I\nthe State. The exercise of autonomy enables an individual to attain\nfulfilment, grow in self-esteem, build relationships of his or her\nchoice and fulfil all legitimate goals that he or she may set. In the\nIndian Constitution, the right to live with dignity and the right of\nprivacy both are recognised as dimensions of Article 21\u2026\u201d218\nSection 377 was held to be a denial of the dignity of an individual and to criminalise\nhis or her core identity solely on account of sexuality would violate Article 21. The\nHigh Court adverted at length to global trends in the protection of privacy \u2013 dignity\nrights of homosexuals, including decisions emanating from the US Supreme Court,\nthe South African Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights. The\nview of the High Court was that a statutory provision targeting homosexuals as a class\nviolates Article 14, and amounted to a hostile discrimination on the grounds of sexual\norientation (outlawed by Article 15). The High Court, however, read down Section 377\nin the manner which has been adverted to above.\n125 When the matter travelled to this Court, Justice Singhvi, speaking for the Bench\ndealt with several grounds including the one based on privacy \u2013 dignity. The Court\nrecognised that the right to privacy which is recognised by Article 12 of the Universal\nDeclaration and Article 17 of ICCPR has been read into Article 21 \u201cthrough expansive\nreading of the right to life and liberty\u201d. This Court, however, found fault with the basis\nof the judgment of the High Court for the following, among other reasons:\n\u201c\u2026the Division Bench of the High Court overlooked that a\nminiscule fraction of the country's population constitutes\n218 Ibid, at page 110 (para 48)\n122\nPART I\nlesbians, gays, bisexuals or transgenders and in last more\nthan 150 years less than 200 persons have been prosecuted\n(as per the reported orders) for committing offence under Section\n377 IPC and this cannot be made sound basis for declaring that\nsection ultra vires the provisions of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the\nConstitution.\u201d219 (emphasis supplied)\nThe privacy and dignity based challenge was repelled with the following observations:\n\u201cIn its anxiety to protect the so-called rights of LGBT persons\nand to declare that Section 377 IPC violates the right to\nprivacy, autonomy and dignity, the High Court has extensively\nrelied upon the judgments of other jurisdictions. Though these\njudgments shed considerable light on various aspects of this right\nand are informative in relation to the plight of sexual minorities, we\nfeel that they cannot be applied blindfolded for deciding the\nconstitutionality of the law enacted by the Indian Legislature.\u201d220\n(emphasis supplied)\n126 Neither of the above reasons can be regarded as a valid constitutional basis\nfor disregarding a claim based on privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution. That\n\u201ca miniscule fraction of the country\u2019s population constitutes lesbians, gays, bisexuals\nor transgenders\u201d (as observed in the judgment of this Court) is not a sustainable basis\nto deny the right to privacy. The purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of\nguaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their exercise from the disdain of\nmajorities, whether legislative or popular. The guarantee of constitutional rights does\nnot depend upon their exercise being favourably regarded by majoritarian opinion.\nThe test of popular acceptance does not furnish a valid basis to disregard rights which\nare conferred with the sanctity of constitutional protection. Discrete and insular\n219 Koushal (Supra note 216), at page 69-70 (para 66)\n220 Ibid, at page 78 (para 77)\n123\nPART I\nminorities face grave dangers of discrimination for the simple reason that their views,\nbeliefs or way of life does not accord with the \u2018mainstream\u2019. Yet in a democratic\nConstitution founded on the rule of law, their rights are as sacred as those conferred\non other citizens to protect their freedoms and liberties. Sexual orientation is an\nessential attribute of privacy. Discrimination against an individual on the basis of\nsexual orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual.\nEquality demands that the sexual orientation of each individual in society must be\nprotected on an even platform. The right to privacy and the protection of sexual\norientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 15 and\n21 of the Constitution.\n127 The view in Koushal that the High Court had erroneously relied upon\ninternational precedents \u201cin its anxiety to protect the so-called rights of LGBT.\npersons\u201d is similarly, in our view, unsustainable. The rights of the lesbian, gay,\nbisexual and transgender population cannot be construed to be \u201cso-called rights\u201d. The\nexpression \u201cso-called\u201d seems to suggest the exercise of a liberty in the garb of a right\nwhich is illusory. This is an inappropriate construction of the privacy based claims of\nthe LGBT population. Their rights are not \u201cso-called\u201d but are real rights founded on\nsound constitutional doctrine. They inhere in the right to life. They dwell in privacy and\ndignity. They constitute the essence of liberty and freedom. Sexual orientation is an\nessential component of identity. Equal protection demands protection of the identity\nof every individual without discrimination.\n124\nPART I\n128 The decision in Koushal presents a de minimis rationale when it asserts that\nthere have been only two hundred prosecutions for violating Section 377. The de\nminimis hypothesis is misplaced because the invasion of a fundamental right is not\nrendered tolerable when a few, as opposed to a large number of persons, are\nsubjected to hostile treatment. The reason why such acts of hostile discrimination are\nconstitutionally impermissible is because of the chilling effect which they have on the\nexercise of the fundamental right in the first place. For instance, pre-publication\nrestraints such as censorship are vulnerable because they discourage people from\nexercising their right to free speech because of the fear of a restraint coming into\noperation. The chilling effect on the exercise of the right poses a grave danger to the\nunhindered fulfilment of one\u2019s sexual orientation, as an element of privacy and dignity.\nThe chilling effect is due to the danger of a human being subjected to social\nopprobrium or disapproval, as reflected in the punishment of crime. Hence the\nKoushal rationale that prosecution of a few is not an index of violation is flawed and\ncannot be accepted. Consequently, we disagree with the manner in which Koushal\nhas dealt with the privacy \u2013 dignity based claims of LGBT persons on this aspect.\nSince the challenge to Section 377 is pending consideration before a larger Bench of\nthis Court, we would leave the constitutional validity to be decided in an appropriate\nproceeding.\n125\nPART J\nJ India\u2019s commitments under International law\n129 The recognition of privacy as a fundamental constitutional value is part of\nIndia\u2019s commitment to a global human rights regime. Article 51 of the Constitution,\nwhich forms part of the Directive Principles, requires the State to endeavour to \u201cfoster\nrespect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings of organised\npeoples with one another\u201d221. Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nrecognises the right to privacy:\n\u201cArticle 12: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with\nhis privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon\nhis honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection\nof the law against such interference or attacks.\u201d\nSimilarly, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was adopted on 16\nDecember 1979 and came into effect on 23 March 1976. India ratified it on 11\nDecember 1977. Article 17 of the ICCPR provides thus:\n\u201cThe obligations imposed by this article require the State to adopt\nlegislative and other measures to give effect to the prohibition\nagainst such interferences and attacks as well as to the protection\nof the right.\u201d\nThe Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 which has been enacted by Parliament\nrefers to the ICCPR as a human rights instrument. Section 2(1)(d) defines human\nrights:\n221 Article 51(c) of the Indian Constitution\n126\nPART J\n\u201chuman rights\u201d means the rights relating to life, liberty, equality and\ndignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied\nin the International Covenants and enforceable by courts in India.\u201d\nSection 2(1)(f) defines International Covenants:\n\u201cInternational Covenants\u201d means the International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural rights adopted by the General\nAssembly of the United Nations on the 16th December, 1966 [and\nsuch other Covenant or Convention adopted by the General\nAssembly of the United Nations as the Central Government may,\nby notification, specify\u201d\nUnder Section 12(f) of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, the National Human\nRights Commission:\n\u201cis entrusted with the function of studying treaties and other\ninternational instruments on human rights and make\nrecommendations for their effective implementation.\u201d\n130 The ICCPR casts an obligation on states to respect, protect and fulfil its norms.\nThe duty of a State to respect mandates that it must not violate the right. The duty to\nprotect mandates that the government must protect it against interference by private\nparties. The duty to fulfil postulates that government must take steps towards\nrealisation of a right. While elaborating the rights under Article 17, general comment\n16 specifically stipulates that:\n\u201c\u2026..there is universal recognition of the fundamental importance,\nand enduring relevance, of the right to privacy and of the need to\nensure that it is safeguarded, in law and practice.\u201d\n127\nPART J\nSignificantly, while acceding to the ICCPR, India did not file any reservation or\ndeclaration to Article 17. While India filed reservations against Articles 1, 9 and 13,\nthere was none to Article 17:\n\u201cArticle 1 refers to the right to self-determination. The reservation to\nArticle 1 states that \u201cthe Government of the Republic of India\ndeclares that the words \u2018the right of self-determination\u2019 appearing in\n[this article] apply only to the peoples under foreign domination and\nthat these words do not apply to sovereign independent States or\nto a section of a people or nation-which is the essence of national\nintegrity. \u2018 The reservation to Article 9, which refers to the right to\nliberty and security of person, detention and compensation payable\non wrongful arrest or detention, states that \u201cthe government of the\nRepublic of India takes the position that the provisions of the article\nshall be so applied as to be in consonance with the provisions of\nclauses (3) to (7) of article 22 of the Constitution of India. Further\nunder the Indian Legal System, there is no enforceable right to\ncompensation for persons claiming to be victims of unlawful arrest\nor detention against the State.\u201d The reservation to Article 13 \u2013 which\nrefers to protections for aliens, states that \u201cthe Government of the\nRepublic of India reserves its right to apply its law relating to\nforeigners.\u201d\nOn 30 June 2014, a report was presented by the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights.222 The report underscores that:\n\u201c\u2026there is universal recognition of the fundamental importance,\nand enduring relevance, of the right to privacy and of the need to\nensure that it is safeguarded, in law and in practice.\u201d223\n222 \u201cThe Right to privacy in the Digital age\u201d, Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights (30 June 2014)\n223 Ibid, at page 5 (para 13)\n128\nPART J\n131 In Bachan Singh v State of Punjab224 (\u201cBachan Singh\u201d), this Court\nconsidered in relation to the death penalty, the obligations assumed by India in\ninternational law, following the ratification of the ICCPR. The Court held that the\nrequirements of Article 6 of the ICCPR are substantially similar to the guarantees\ncontained in Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution. The penal law of India was held to\nbe in accord with its international commitments. In Francis Coralie, this Court, while\nexplaining the ambit of Article 21, held that:\n\u201c\u2026there is implicit in Article 21 the right to protection against torture\nor cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment which is enunciated in\nArticle 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\nguaranteed by Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and\nPolitical Rights\u2026\u201d225\n132 In Vishaka v State of Rajasthan226, this Court observed that in the absence of\ndomestic law, the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women\n(CEDAW) is applicable. In NALSA, while dealing with the rights of transgenders, this\nCourt found that the international conventions were not inconsistent with the\nfundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and must be recognised and\nfollowed.\n133 The position in law is well settled. Where there is a contradiction between\ninternational law and a domestic statute, the Court would give effect to the latter. In\n224 (1980) 2 SCC 684\n225 Francis Coralie (Supra note 159), at page 619 (para 8)\n226 (1997) 6 SCC 241\n129\nPART K\nthe present case, there is no contradiction between the international obligations which\nhave been assumed by India and the Constitution. The Court will not readily presume\nany inconsistency. On the contrary, constitutional provisions must be read and\ninterpreted in a manner which would enhance their conformity with the global human\nrights regime. India is a responsible member of the international community and the\nCourt must adopt an interpretation which abides by the international commitments\nmade by the country particularly where its constitutional and statutory mandates\nindicate no deviation. In fact, the enactment of the Human Rights Act by Parliament\nwould indicate a legislative desire to implement the human rights regime founded on\nconstitutional values and international conventions acceded to by India.\nK Comparative Law\n134 This section analyses the evolution of the concept of privacy in other\njurisdictions from a comparative law perspective. The Court is conscious of the limits\nof a comparative approach. Each country is governed by its own constitutional and\nlegal structure. Constitutional structures have an abiding connection with the history,\nculture, political doctrine and values which a society considers as its founding\nprinciples. Foreign judgments must hence be read with circumspection ensuring that\nthe text is not read isolated from its context. The countries which have been dealt with\nare:\n(i) United Kingdom;\n(ii) United States;\n(iii) South Africa; and\n130\nPART K\n(iv) Canada.\nThe narrative will then proceed to examine the decisions of the European Court of\nHuman Rights, the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Inter-American\nCourt of Human Rights. These decisions are indicative of the manner in which the\nright to privacy has been construed in diverse jurisdictions based on the histories of\nthe societies they govern and the challenges before them.\n(i) U K decisions\nThe first common law case regarding protection of privacy is said to be Semayne\u2019s\nCase227 (1604). The case related to the entry into a property by the Sheriff of London\nin order to execute a valid writ. The case is famous for the words of Sir Edward Coke:\n\u201cThat the house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as\nwell for his defence against injury and violence, as for his repose \u2026\u201d\nThen, in the case of Entick v Carrington228 (1765), Entick\u2019s house had been forcibly\nentered into by agents of the State/King. Lord Camden CJ held that:\n\u201cBy the laws of England, every invasion of private property, be it\never so minute, is a trespass. No man can set his foot upon my\nground without my licence, but he is liable to an action, though the\ndamage be nothing; which is proved by every declaration in\ntrespass, where the defendant is called upon to answer for bruising\nthe grass and even treading upon the soil.\u201d\n227 Peter Semayne v Richard Gresham, 77 ER 194\n228 (1765) 19 St. Tr. 1029\n131\nPART K\nPrivacy jurisprudence developed further in the 19th century. In 1849, in Prince Albert\nv Strange229 (1849), publication was sought to be restrained of otherwise unpublished\nprivate etchings and lists of works done by Prince Albert and Queen Victoria. In the\nHigh Court of Chancery, Lord Cottenham observed that:\n\u201c\u2026 where privacy is the right invaded, postponing the injunction\nwould be equivalent to denying it altogether. The interposition of\nthis Court in these cases does not depend upon any legal right, and\nto be effectual, it must be immediate.\u201d\nHowever, the approach adopted by the Court in Prince Albert case took a different\nturn in the case of Kaye v Robertson230 (1991). In this case, when the appellant, after\nan accident, was recovering from brain surgery in a private hospital room, two\njournalists posed as doctors and took photographs of him. The appellant attempted to\nobtain an order to restrain publication of the photographs. The Court of Appeal held\nthat:\n\u201c\u2026 in English law there is no right to privacy, and accordingly there\nis no right of action for breach of a person's privacy\u201d\nThe decision in R v Director of Serious Fraud Office, ex parte Smith231 (1993)\ndiscussed the question of the right to silence. The applicant (the chairman and\nmanaging director of a company) was charged of doing acts with the intent to defraud\nits creditors. After having been cautioned, he was asked to answer questions of the\nDirector of the Serious Fraud Office. The issue was whether the requirement to\n229 (1849) 41 ER 1171\n230 [1991] FSR 62\n231 [1993] AC 1\n132\nPART K\nanswer questions infringed the right to silence. It was held that the powers of the\nDirector of the Serious Fraud Office, under the Criminal Justice Act 1987, entitled\nhim/her to compel the applicant to answer questions on pain of commission of a\ncriminal offence. Lord Mustill, who delivered the leading opinion of the Court, held\nthat:\n\u201c[It] is a simple reflection of the common view that one person\nshould so far as possible be entitled to tell another person to mind\nhis own business. All civilised states recognise this assertion of\npersonal liberty and privacy. Equally, although there may be\npronounced disagreements between states, and between individual\ncitizens within states, about where the line should be drawn, few\nwould dispute that some curtailment of the liberty is indispensable\nto the stability of society; and indeed in the United Kingdom today\nour lives are permeated by enforceable duties to provide\ninformation on demand, created by Parliament and tolerated by the\nmajority, albeit in some cases with reluctance.\u201d\nLord Mustill\u2019s statement \u201cunderlines the approach taken by the common law to\nprivacy\u201d that \u201cit recognised privacy as a principle of general value\u201d and that \u201cprivacy\nhad only been given discrete and specific protection at common law\u201d.232\nThis approach was diluted in the case of Wainwright v Home Office233(2004), where\na mother and son were subjected to a strip-search when visiting a prison in 1997, in\naccordance with existing Prison Rules. The son, who was mentally impaired and\nsuffered from cerebral palsy, later developed post-traumatic stress disorder. Claims\nfor damages arising from trespass and trespass to the person were issued. At the time\n232 Lord Neuberger, \u201cPrivacy in the 21st Century\u201d, UK Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists' Lecture (28\nNovember 2012)\n233 [2004] 2 AC 406\n133\nPART K\nof the incident, the Human Rights Act, 1998 (HRA) had not yet come into force. When\nthe case reached before House of Lords, it was argued that \u201cthe law of tort should\ngive a remedy for any kind of distress caused by an infringement of the right of privacy\nprotected by article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights\u201d.\nIt was further argued that reliance must be placed upon the judgment of Sedley LJ in\nDouglas v Hello! Ltd234 (2001), where it was said that:\n\"What a concept of privacy does, however, is accord\nrecognition to the fact that the law has to protect not only those\npeople whose trust has been abused but those who simply find\nthemselves subjected to an unwanted intrusion into their\npersonal lives. The law no longer needs to construct an artificial\nrelationship of confidentiality between intruder and victim: it can\nrecognise privacy itself as a legal principle drawn from the\nfundamental value of personal autonomy.\" (emphasis supplied)\nHowever, Lord Hoffman in Wainwright rejected all the contentions and held that:\n\u201cI do not understand Sedley LJ to have been advocating the\ncreation of a high-level principle of invasion of privacy. His\nobservations are in my opinion no more (although certainly no less)\nthan a plea for the extension and possibly renaming of the old action\nfor breach of confidence.\u201d\nLord Hoffman also observed that:\n\u201cWhat the courts have so far refused to do is to formulate a general\nprinciple of \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d \u2026\nThere seems to me a great difference between identifying privacy\nas a value which underlies the existence of a rule of law (and may\npoint the direction in which the law should develop) and privacy as\na principle of law in itself. The English common law is familiar with\n234 [2001] QB 967\n134\nPART K\nthe notion of underlying values - principles only in the broadest\nsense - which direct its development\u2026\nNor is there anything in the jurisprudence of the European Court of\nHuman Rights which suggests that the adoption of some high level\nprinciple of privacy is necessary to comply with article 8 of the\nConvention. The European Court is concerned only with whether\nEnglish law provides an adequate remedy in a specific case in\nwhich it considers that there has been an invasion of privacy\ncontrary to article 8(1) and not justifiable under article 8(2).\u201d\nThere has been a transformation in this approach after the Human Rights Act, 1998\n(HRA) came into force. For the first time, privacy was incorporated as a right under\nthe British law.235 In Campbell v MGN236 (2004), a well-known model was\nphotographed leaving a rehabilitation clinic, following public denials that she was a\nrecovering drug addict. The photographs were published in a publication run by MGN.\nShe sought damages under the English law through her lawyers to bring a claim for\nbreach of confidence engaging Section 6 of the Human Rights Act. The House of\nLords by majority decided in her favour. Lord Hope writing for the majority held:\n\u201c[I]f there is an intrusion in a situation where a person can\nreasonably expect his privacy to be respected, that intrusion will be\ncapable of giving rise to liability unless the intrusion can be\njustified\u2026 [A] duty of confidence arises when confidential\ninformation comes to the knowledge of a person where he has\nnotice that the information is confidential.\u201d\n235 The UK Human Rights Act incorporates the rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights\n(ECHR) into domestic British law. The Preamble of the Act states that it \u201cgives further effect to rights and\nfreedoms guaranteed\u201d under the ECHR. Under the Act (S. 6), it is unlawful for any public authority, including a\ncourt or tribunal at any level, to act in a manner which is incompatible with a Convention right. The Convention\nrights take precedence over rules of common law or equity, and over most subordinate legislations. The Act,\nthereby, protects the right to privacy, which has been provided under Article 8 (1) of the ECHR. See Ben\nEmmerson et al. (ed), Human Rights and Criminal Justice, Sweet & Maxwell (2000). See also \u201cConcerns and\nIdeas about the Developing English Law of Privacy\u201d, Institute of Global Law, available online at\nhttp://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/global_law/publications/institute/docs/privacy_100804.pdf.\n236 [2004] 2 AC 457.\n135\nPART K\nIn holding so, Lord Hope relied upon the following statement of Lord Woolf in A v B\nInc237 (2003):\n\u201cA duty of confidence will arise whenever a party subject to the duty\nis in a situation where he either knows or ought to know that the\nother person can reasonably expect his privacy to be protected.\u201d\nLord Hope also held that the Courts, in order to decide a case, must carry out a\n\u201cbalancing operation, weighing the public interest in maintaining confidence against a\ncountervailing public interest favouring disclosure\u201d.\nBaroness Hale wrote a concurring judgment and held that:\n\u201cThe Human Rights 1998 Act does not create any new cause of action\nbetween private persons. But if there is a relevant cause of action\napplicable, the court as a public authority must act compatibly with both\nparties' Convention rights. In a case such as this, the relevant vehicle\nwill usually be the action for breach of confidence, as Lord Woolf CJ\nheld in A v B plc [2002] EWCA Civ 337, [2003] QB 195, 202, para 4 :\n\"[Articles 8 and 10] have provided new parameters\nwithin which the court will decide, in an action for\nbreach of confidence, whether a person is entitled\nto have his privacy protected by the court or\nwhether the restriction of freedom of expression\nwhich such protection involves cannot be justified.\nThe court's approach to the issues which the\napplications raise has been modified because,\nunder section 6 of the 1998 Act, the court, as a\npublic authority, is required not to 'act in a way\nwhich is incompatible with a Convention right'. The\ncourt is able to achieve this by absorbing the rights\nwhich articles 8 and 10 protect into the long-\nestablished action for breach of confidence. This\ninvolves giving a new strength and breadth to the\naction so that it accommodates the requirements of\nthese articles.\"\n237 [2003] QB 195\n136\nPART K\nLater, in Douglas v Hello! Ltd238, it was held that:\n\u201cWhat the House [in Campbell] was agreed upon was that the\nknowledge, actual or imputed, that information is private will\nnormally impose on anyone publishing that information the duty to\njustify what, in the absence of justification, will be a wrongful\ninvasion of privacy.\u201d\nSubsequent cases establish the contribution the HRA has made in jurisprudence on\nprivacy in the UK. In Associated Newspapers Limited v His Royal Highness the\nPrince of Wales239 (2006), an appeal was made against the judgment in respect of\nthe claim of Prince Charles for breach of confidence and infringement of copyright.\nThe case brought about when \u2018The Mail on Sunday\u2019 published extracts of a dispatch\nby the Prince of Wales. The Court held that:\n\u201cThe information at issue in this case is private information, public\ndisclosure of which constituted an interference with Prince Charles\u2019\nArticle 8 rights. As heir to the throne, Prince Charles is an important\npublic figure. In respect of such persons the public takes an interest\nin information about them that is relatively trivial. For this reason\npublic disclosure of such information can be particularly intrusive\u2026\nPrince Charles has a valid claim based on breach of confidence and\ninterference with his Article 8 rights.\u201d\nIn Murray v Big Pictures (UK) Ltd240 (2008), a photographer had taken a series of\nphotographs of a writer\u2019s infant son, which were later published in a newspaper. The\nissue was whether there was misuse of private information by taking photographs. It\nwas held that:\n238 [2006] QB 125\n239 [2006] EWCA Civ 1776\n240 [2008] 3 WLR 1360\n137\nPART K\n\u201c[The] question of whether there is a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy is a broad one, which takes account of all the circumstances\nof the case.

The fact that he is a child is in our view of\ngreater significance than the judge thought.\u201d\nR v The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis241 (2011) was a case concerning\nthe extent of the police's power (under guidelines issued by the Association of Chief\nPolice Officers- the ACPO guidelines) to indefinitely retain biometric data associated\nwith individuals who are no longer suspected of a criminal offence. The UK Supreme\nCourt, by a majority held that the police force's policy of retaining DNA evidence in the\nabsence of 'exceptional circumstances' was unlawful and a violation of Article 8 of the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights. Lord Dyson, on behalf of the majority, held\nthat:\n\u201cIt is important that, in such an important and sensitive area as the\nretention of biometric data by the police, the court reflects its\ndecision by making a formal order to declare what it considers to be\nthe true legal position. But it is not necessary to go further. Section\n8(1) of the HRA gives the court a wide discretion to grant such relief\nor remedy within its powers as it considers just and appropriate.\nSince Parliament is already seized of the matter, it is neither just\nnor appropriate to make an order requiring a change in the\nlegislative scheme within a specific period\u2026\n241 [2011] UKSC 21\n138\nPART K\n\u2026.he present ACPO guidelines are unlawful because they are\nincompatible with article 8 of the ECHR.

The issue\ninvolved was: \u201cWhether the publication of photographs by the police to identify a young\nperson suspected of being involved in riotous behaviour and attempted criminal damage\ncan ever be a necessary and proportionate interference with that person\u2019s article 8\nrights?\u201d The majority held that Article 8 was not engaged, as there was no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in the case. Lord Toulson (with whom Lord Hodge agreed), while\nstating that the conduct of the police did not amount, prima facie, to an interference with\nthe appellant\u2019s right to respect for his private life, held that:\n\u201cThe reasonable or legitimate expectation test is an objective test.\nIt is to be applied broadly, taking account of all the circumstances\nof the case (as Sir Anthony Clarke said in Murray\u2019s case) and having\nregard to underlying value or values to be protected. Thus, for\nexample, the publication of a photograph of a young person acting\nin a criminal manner for the purpose of enabling the police to\ndiscover his identity may not fall within the scope of the protection\nof personal autonomy which is the purpose of article 8, but the\npublication of the same photograph for another purpose might.\u201d\n242 [2015] UKSC 42\n139\nPART K\nLord Clarke wrote a separate judgment concurring with Lord Toulson and held that:\n\u201c\u2026 the criminal nature of what the appellant was doing was not an\naspect of his private life that he was entitled to keep private. He\ncould not have had an objectively reasonable expectation that such\nphotographs, taken for the limited purpose of identifying who he\nwas, would not be published.\u201d\nThe decision in PJS v News Group Newspapers Ltd243 (2016) dealt with an\nanonymised privacy injunction244. The injunction was sought by the claimant to\nrestrain publication of details of his sexual relationship with two other people, on the\nground that the publication would breach his rights to privacy and confidentiality,\nprotected by Article 8 of ECHR. The UK Supreme Court by majority ruled in favour\nof the applicant. Speaking on behalf of the majority, Lord Mance held that:\n\u201c\u2026 having regard to the nature of the material sought to be\npublished and the identity and financial circumstances of the\nappellant, that the appellant\u2019s real concern is indeed with the\ninvasion of privacy that would be involved in further disclosure and\npublication in the English media, and that any award of damages,\nhowever assessed, would be an inadequate remedy.\u201d\nThe HRA has rendered clarity on the existence of a right to privacy in UK\njurisprudence and substantially resolved conflicting approaches regarding privacy in\ndecided cases. The HRA, by incorporating the provisions of the European\n243 [2016] UKSC 26\n244 In English law, an anonymised injunction is \u201can interim injunction which restrains a person from publishing\ninformation which concerns the applicant and is said to be confidential or private where the names of either\nor both of the parties to the proceedings are not stated\u201d.

The Convention, together with its adoption into\ndomestic legislation, has led to a considerable change in the development of\nprotection of human privacy in English law.\n(ii) US Supreme Court decisions\nThe US Constitution does not contain an express right to privacy. But American\nprivacy jurisprudence reflects that it has been protected under several amendments245\nof the US Constitution.\nAs early as 1886, in Boyd v United States246, the question before the US Supreme\nCourt was whether compulsory production of a person\u2019s private papers to be used in\nevidence against him in a judicial proceeding, is an unreasonable search and seizure\nwithin the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Justice Bradley delivered the opinion\nof the Court and held as follows:\n\u201cThe principles laid down in this opinion affect the very essence of\nconstitutional liberty and security\u2026 they apply to all invasions\non the part of the government and its employees of the sanctity\nof a man's home and the privacies of life. It is not the breaking\nof his doors and the rummaging of his drawers that constitutes\nthe essence of the offence, but it is the invasion of his\nindefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty, and\nprivate property, -- it is the invasion of this sacred right ...\n245The concept of privacy plays a major role in the jurisprudence of the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments. The Ninth Amendment has also been interpreted to justify broadly reading the Bill of Rights to\nprotect privacy in ways not specifically provided in the first eight amendments.\n246 116 US 616 (1886)\n141\nPART K\nAnd any compulsory discovery by extorting the party's oath, or\ncompelling the production of his private books and papers, to\nconvict him of crime or to forfeit his property, is contrary to the\nprinciples of a free government... It may suit the purposes of\ndespotic power, but it cannot abide the pure atmosphere of political\nliberty and personal freedom.\u201d (emphasis supplied)\nIn two decisions in the 1920s, the Court read the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s liberty to\nprohibit states from making laws interfering with the private decisions of parents and\neducators to shape the education of their children. In Meyer v Nebraska247 (1923),\nthe Court struck down a state law that prohibited the teaching of foreign languages to\nstudents that had not yet completed the eighth grade. The Court in a 7:2 decision,\nwritten by Justice McReynolds, concluded that the state failed to show a compelling\nneed to infringe upon the rights of parents and teachers to decide on the best course\nof education for young students. On liberty, Justice McReynolds held:\n\u201cWithout doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint, but\nalso the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common\noccupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a\nhome and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of\nhis own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long\nrecognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness\nby free men. The established doctrine is that this liberty may not be\ninterfered with, under the guise of protecting the public interest, by\nlegislative action which is arbitrary or without reasonable relation to some\npurpose within the competency of the State to effect.\u201d\n247 262 US 390 (1923)\n142\nPART K\nTwo years later, in Pierce v Society of Sisters248 (1925), the Court, relying upon\nMayer v Nebraska, struck down the Oregon Compulsory Education Act, which\nmandated all children (between eight and sixteen years) to attend public schools. It\nwas held the said statute is an \u201cunreasonable interference with the liberty of the\nparents and guardians to direct the upbringing of the children, and in that respect\nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d.\nIn Olmstead v United States249 (1928), the question before the Court was whether\nthe use of evidence of private telephone conversations, intercepted by means of\nwiretapping amounted to a violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. In a 5:4\ndecision, it was held that there was no violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\nChief Justice Taft wrote the majority judgment, holding that:\n\u201cThe Amendment itself shows that the search is to be of material\nthings -- the person, the house, his papers, or his effects\u2026. The\nAmendment does not forbid what was done here. There was no\nsearching. There was no seizure. The evidence was secured by the\nuse of the sense of hearing, and that only. There was no entry of\nthe houses or offices of the defendants.\u201d\nHowever, Justice Louis Brandeis wrote a dissenting opinion and observed that:\n\u201c\u2026 time works changes, brings into existence new conditions and\npurposes.\" Subtler and more far-reaching means of invading\nprivacy have become available to the Government. Discovery and\ninvention have made it possible for the Government, by means far\nmore effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in\ncourt of what is whispered in the closet. Moreover, \u201cin the\n248 (268) US 510 (1925)\n249 277 US 438 (1928)\n143\nPART K\napplication of a constitution, our contemplation cannot be only\nof what has, been but of what may be.\u201d The progress of science\nin furnishing the Government with means of espionage is not likely\nto stop with wiretapping. Ways may someday be developed by\nwhich the Government, without removing papers from secret\ndrawers, can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be\nenabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the\nhome. Advances in the psychic and related sciences may bring\nmeans of exploring unexpressed beliefs, thoughts and emotions\u2026\u201d\n(emphasis supplied)\nHe questioned whether the Constitution affords no protection against such invasions\nof individual security. Justice Brandeis answers this question in a celebrated passage:\n\u201cThe makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions\nfavorable to the pursuit of happiness. They sought to protect\nAmericans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their\nsensations. They conferred, as against the Government, the\nright to be let alone -- the most comprehensive of rights, and\nthe right most valued by civilized men. To protect that right,\nevery unjustifiable intrusion by the Government upon the privacy of\nthe individual, whatever the means employed, must be deemed a\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment...\u201d (emphasis supplied)\nThe Court, in the case of Griswold v Connecticut250 (1965), invalidated a state law\nprohibiting the possession, sale, and distribution of contraceptives to married couples,\nfor the reason that the law violated the right to marital privacy. Justice Douglas, who\ndelivered the main opinion, observed that this right emanated from \u201cpenumbras\u201d of\nthe fundamental constitutional guarantees and rights in the Bill of Rights, which\ntogether create \u201czones of privacy\u201d. Accordingly, it was held that:\n250 381 US 479 (1965)\n144\nPART K\n\u201cThe present case, then concerns a relationship lying within the\nzone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional\nguarantees\u2026 Would we allow the police to search the sacred\nprecincts of marital bedrooms of telltale signs of the use of\ncontraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy\nsurrounding the marriage relationship.\u201d\nJustice Goldberg wrote in the concurring opinion that:\n\u201cThe fact that no particular provision of the Constitution explicitly\nforbids the State from disrupting the traditional relation of the family\n-- a relation as old and as fundamental as our entire civilization --\nsurely does not show that the Government was meant to have the\npower to do so. Rather, as the Ninth Amendment expressly\nrecognizes, there are fundamental personal rights such as this one,\nwhich are protected from abridgment by the Government, though\nnot specifically mentioned in the Constitution.\u201d\nThe 1967 decision in Katz v United States251 (\u201cKatz\u201d) overruled Olmstead v United\nStates (supra) and revolutionized the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment\nregarding the extent to which a constitutional right to privacy applies against\ngovernment interference. In this case, Charles Katz was a gambler who used a public\ntelephone booth to transmit illegal wagers. Unbeknownst to Katz, the FBI which was\ninvestigating Katz\u2019s activity, was recording his conversations via an electronic\neavesdropping device attached to the exterior of the phone booth. Subsequently, Katz\nwas convicted based on these recordings. He challenged his conviction, arguing that\nthe recordings were obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The\nconstitutional question in the case was whether the 4th Amendment protection from\n\u2018unreasonable searches and seizures\u2019 was restricted to the search and seizure of\n251 389 US 347 (1967)\n145\nPART K\ntangible property, or did it extend to intangible areas such as conversations overheard\nby others. It was held that the Government's eavesdropping activities violated the\nprivacy, upon which petitioner justifiably relied, while using the telephone booth, and\nthus constituted a \u201csearch and seizure\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,\nand that the Amendment governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends\nas well to the recording of oral statements.\nPrior to 1967 when determining the \u2018reasonable expectation of privacy\u2019 for purposes\nof discussing Fourth Amendment violations, the analysis was focused on whether the\nauthority had trespassed on a private location. This \u2018trespass doctrine\u2019 was the\nprevailing test until Katz, which extended the protection of the Fourth Amendment\nfrom \u2018places\u2019 to \u2018people\u2019, affording individuals more privacy even in public. The\n\u2018trespass doctrine\u2019 applied in Olmstead v United States (supra) was held to be no\nlonger relevant.\nJustice Stewart wrote the majority (7:1) opinion and held that:\n\u201cOne who occupies it [a telephone booth], shuts the door behind\nhim, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely\nentitled to assume that the words he utters into the\nmouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world. To read the\nConstitution more narrowly is to ignore the vital role that the\npublic telephone has come to play in private communication.\u201d\n(emphasis supplied)\nJustice Harlan wrote the concurring judgment holding that:\n\u201ca) that an enclosed telephone booth is an area where, like a\nhome\u2026 a person has a constitutionally protected reasonable\nexpectation of privacy; (b) that electronic, as well as physical,\n146\nPART K\nintrusion into a place that is in this sense private may\nconstitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment....\u201d\n(emphasis supplied)\nThe reasonable expectation of privacy test was formulated as follows:\n\u201c....the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.\" The\nquestion, however, is what protection it affords to those\npeople. Generally, as here, the answer to that question requires\nreference to a \"place.\" My understanding of the rule that has\nemerged from prior decisions is that there is a twofold requirement,\nfirst that a person has exhibited an actual (subjective)\nexpectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be\none that society is prepared to recognize as \"reasonable.\"\nThus, a man's home is, for most purposes, a place where he\nexpects privacy, but objects, activities, or statements that he\nexposes to the \"plain view\" of outsiders are not \"protected,\"\nbecause no intention to keep them to himself has been\nexhibited. On the other hand, conversations in the open would\nnot be protected against being overheard, for the expectation\nof privacy under the circumstances would be unreasonable.\u201d\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn Stanley v Georgia252 (1969), the Court analyzed the constitutionality of a statute\nimposing criminal sanctions upon the knowing possession of obscene matter. The\nCourt, in a unanimous decision, held that mere private possession of obscene matter\ncannot constitutionally be made a crime:\n\u201cFor also fundamental is the right to be free, except in very limited\ncircumstances, from unwanted governmental intrusions into one's\nprivacy...\n[T]he rights that the appellant is asserting in the case before us...the\nright to read or observe what he pleases -- the right to satisfy his\nintellectual and emotional needs in the privacy of his own\nhome\u2026..the right to be free from state inquiry into the contents of\nhis library...\n252 394 US 557 (1969)\n147\nPART K\nWhatever the power of the state to control public dissemination of\nideas inimical to the public morality, it cannot constitutionally\npremise legislation on the desirability of controlling a person's\nprivate thoughts.\u201d\nSeven years after Griswold, the Court expanded the right to privacy beyond the\n\u2018marital bedroom\u2019 to include unmarried persons. In Eisenstadt v Baird253 (1972), the\nCourt invalidated a law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried\npersons, ruling that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution:\n\u201cIt is true that in Griswold the right of privacy in question inhered in\nthe marital relationship. Yet the marital couple is not an independent\nentity with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two\nindividuals each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup.\nIf the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual,\nmarried or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental\nintrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the\ndecision whether to bear or beget a child.\u201d\nThe decision in Paris Adult Theatre I v Slaton254 (1973), upheld a state court's\ninjunction against the showing of obscene films in a movie theatre, restricted to\nconsenting adults. The Court distinguished the case from Stanley v Georgia (supra),\non the ground that the privacy of the home in Stanley was not the same as the\ncommercial exhibition of obscene movies in a theatre. Chief Justice Burger observed\nthat the prior decisions of the Supreme Court on the right to privacy only included\nthose personal rights that were \u201cfundamental\" or \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered\n253 405 US 438 (1972)\n254 413 US 49 (1973)\n148\nPART K\nliberty\u201d such as \u201cthe personal intimacies of the home, the family, marriage,\nmotherhood, procreation and childbearing\u201d and held that:\n\u201cNothing, however, in this Court's decisions intimates that there is\nany \"fundamental\" privacy right \"implicit in the concept of ordered\nliberty\" to watch obscene movies in places of public\naccommodation\u2026 The idea of a \"privacy\" right and a place of public\naccommodation are, in this context, mutually exclusive.\u201d\nIn the landmark decision on the right to abortion, Roe v Wade255 (1973), the Court\ndealt with the question of the right of an unmarried pregnant woman to terminate her\npregnancy by abortion. The constitutionality of a Texas Statute prohibiting abortions\nexcept with respect to those procured or admitted by medical advice for the purpose\nof saving the life of the mother was challenged on the ground that the law improperly\ninvaded the right and the choice of a pregnant woman to terminate her pregnancy and\nwas violative of the \u201cliberty\u201d guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment and the\nright to privacy recognized in Griswold. The Court ruled 7:2 that a right to privacy\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment extended to a woman's\ndecision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state's\ninterests in regulating abortions. Justice Blackmun delivered the majority judgment\nand held that:\n\u201cThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of\nprivacy. In a line of decisions, however, the Court has\nrecognised that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of\ncertain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the\nConstitution. In varying contexts, the Court or individual Justices\nhave, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the First\nAmendment; in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights; in the Ninth\n255 410 US 113 (1973)\n149\nPART K\nAmendment; or in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first\nsection of the Fourteenth Amendment...\nThis right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth\nAmendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions\nupon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court\ndetermined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to\nthe people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision\nwhether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\u201d (emphasis supplied)\nThe right to privacy in bank records was analysed by the US Supreme Court in United\nStates v Miller256 (1976). In this case federal agents were investigating the defendant\nfor his involvement in a bootlegging conspiracy. The agents subpoenaed two banks\nand received his bank records. As a result, he was indicted. The question was whether\nan individual reasonably can expect that records kept incidental to his personal\nbanking transactions will be protected from uncontrolled government inspection. In a\n6:3 opinion, the Supreme Court held that a bank depositor has no Fourth Amendment\ninterest in the records that his bank is required to keep in compliance with the Bank\nSecrecy Act of 1970, and that Miller had no right to privacy in his bank records. Writing\nfor the majority, Justice Lewis F. Powell asserted that the \u201cdocuments subpoenaed...\nare not [Miller\u2019s] \u2018private papers\u2019,\u201d but instead, part of the bank\u2019s business records. It\nwas held:\n\u201cThere is no legitimate \"expectation of privacy\" in the contents\nof the original checks and deposit slips, since the checks are\nnot confidential communications, but negotiable instruments\nto be used in commercial transactions, and all the documents\nobtained contain only information voluntarily conveyed to the banks\nand exposed to their employees in the ordinary course of business.\n256 425 US 435 (1976)\n150\nPART K\nThe Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of\ninformation revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to\nGovernment authorities. The Act's recordkeeping requirements do\nnot alter these considerations so as to create a protectable Fourth\nAmendment interest of a bank depositor in the bank's records of his\naccount.\u201d\nHowever, Justice Brennan dissented and held that:\n\u201cA bank customer's reasonable expectation is that, absent a\ncompulsion by legal process, the matters he reveals to the bank will\nbe utilized by the bank only for internal banking purposes... [A]\ndepositor reveals many aspects of his personal affairs, opinions,\nhabits, associations. Indeed, the totality of bank records provides a\nvirtual current biography\u2026Development of...sophisticated\ninstruments have accelerated the ability of the government to\nintrude into areas which a person normally chooses to exclude from\nprying eyes and inquisitive minds. Consequently, judicial\ninterpretations of the constitutional protection of individual privacy\nmust keep pace with the perils created by these new devices.\u201d\nContinuing its trend of expansion of individual rights in the 1960s and 1970s,\nparticularly in the domain of reproductive health - the right to contraceptives as well\nas the right to abortion, the decision in Carey v Population Services International257\n(1977) expanded these rights from adults to also include minors. In this case, a New\nYork law banning sale of even non-prescription contraceptives by persons other than\nlicensed pharmacists; sale or distribution to minors under sixteen; and contraceptive\ndisplay and advertising was declared unconstitutional. Justice Brennan delivered the\nmajority opinion of the Court and held that the Fourteenth Amendment is not for \u201cadults\nalone\u201d and \u201cMinors, as well as adults, are protected by the Constitution\u201d:\n257 431 US 678 (1977)\n151\nPART K\n\u201cThis right of personal privacy includes \"the interest in\nindependence in making certain kinds of important decisions.\" ...\nWhile the outer limits of this aspect of privacy have not been marked\nby the Court, it is clear that among the decisions that an individual\nmay make without unjustified government interference are personal\ndecisions \"relating to marriage...; procreation...; contraception...;\nfamily relationships...; and childrearing and education...\u201d\nIt was further held that:\n\u201cThe decision whether or not to beget or bear a child is at the very\nheart of this cluster of constitutionally protected choices... This is\nunderstandable, for in a field that, by definition, concerns the most\nintimate of human activities and relationships, decisions whether to\naccomplish or to prevent conception are among the most private\nand sensitive\u2026\u201d\nThe Court also held that the right to privacy may be limited by a regulation,\nwhich is governed by a sufficient \u2018compelling state interest\u2019.\nIn Smith v Maryland258 (1979), it was held that installation and use of a \u2018pen register\u2019\nwas not a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and hence no\nwarrant was required. Justice Blackmun delivered the majority (5: 4) opinion and held\nthat the petitioner\u2019s claim that he had a \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy\u201d could not\nbe sustained:\n\u201cFirst, we doubt that people in general entertain any actual\nexpectation of privacy in the numbers they dial. All telephone\nusers realize that they must \"convey\" phone numbers to the\ntelephone company, since it is through telephone company\n258 442 US 735 (1979)\n152\nPART K\nswitching equipment that their calls are completed. All subscribers\nrealize, moreover, that the phone company has facilities for making\npermanent records of the numbers they dial, for they see a list of\ntheir long-distance (toll) calls on their monthly bills. In fact, pen\nregisters and similar devices are routinely used by telephone\ncompanies \"for the purposes of checking billing operations,\ndetecting fraud, and preventing violations of law.\" (emphasis\nsupplied)\nThe majority adopted the \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d test as formulated by\nJustice Harlan in Katz and held as follows:\n\u201c[The] inquiry, as Mr. Justice Harlan aptly noted in his Katz\nconcurrence, normally embraces two discrete questions. The first\nis whether the individual, by his conduct, has \"exhibited an actual\n(subjective) expectation of privacy\"... whether... the individual has\nshown that \"he seeks to preserve [something] as private\"... The\nsecond question is whether the individual's subjective expectation\nof privacy is \"one that society is prepared to recognize as\nreasonable,'\"... whether... the individual's expectation, viewed\nobjectively, is \"justifiable\" under the circumstances.\nSince the pen register was installed on telephone company\nproperty at the telephone company's central offices, petitioner\nobviously cannot claim that his \"property\" was invaded or that\npolice intruded into a \"constitutionally protected area.\"\nThus the Court held that the petitioner in all probability entertained no actual\nexpectation of privacy in the phone numbers he dialled, and that, even if he did, his\nexpectation was not \u201clegitimate.\u201d However, the judgment also noted the limitations of\nthe Katz test:\n\u201cSituations can be imagined, of course, in which Katz' two-\npronged inquiry would provide an inadequate index of Fourth\nAmendment protection\u2026 In such circumstances, where an\nindividual's subjective expectations had been \"conditioned\" by\ninfluences alien to well recognized Fourth Amendment freedoms,\nthose subjective expectations obviously could play no meaningful\n153\nPART K\nrole in ascertaining what the scope of Fourth Amendment protection\nwas. \u201c\nJustice Stewart wrote the dissent, joined by Justice Brennan and held that there was\na legitimate expectation of privacy in this case:\n\u201c...the numbers dialled from a private telephone -- like the\nconversations that occur during a call -- are within the constitutional\nprotection recognized in Katz. It seems clear to me that information\nobtained by pen register surveillance of a private telephone is\ninformation in which the telephone subscriber has a legitimate\nexpectation of privacy. The information captured by such\nsurveillance emanates from private conduct within a person's home\nor office -- locations that without question are entitled to Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendment protection. Further, that information is an\nintegral part of the telephonic communication that, under Katz, is\nentitled to constitutional protection\u2026\u201d\nJustice Marshal dissented and opined on the dangers of permitting such surveillance,\nholding:\n\u201cThe use of pen registers, I believe, constitutes such an extensive\nintrusion. To hold otherwise ignores the vital role telephonic\ncommunication plays in our personal and professional\nrelationships, as well as the First and Fourth Amendment interests\nimplicated by unfettered official surveillance. Privacy in placing calls\nis of value not only to those engaged in criminal activity. The\nprospect of unregulated governmental monitoring will undoubtedly\nprove disturbing even to those with nothing illicit to hide. Many\nindividuals, including members of unpopular political organizations\nor journalists with confidential sources, may legitimately wish to\navoid disclosure of their personal contacts...\nPermitting governmental access to telephone records on less\nthan probable cause may thus impede certain forms of political\naffiliation and journalistic endeavor that are the hallmark of a\ntruly free society.

The Court\nreaffirmed- what it called- the \u201cessential holding\u201d260 of Roe v Wade (supra), and\nobserved:\n\u201c...Our precedents \u201chave respected the private realm of family life\nwhich the state cannot enter.\u201d ... These matters, involving the most\nintimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime,\nchoices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the\nliberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of\nliberty is the right to define one\u2019s own concept of existence, of\nmeaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs\nabout these matters could not define the attributes of personhood\nwere they formed under compulsion of the State\u2026\nThe woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy before viability is the\nmost central principle of Roe v.

The Court answered this\nquestion in the negative. Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the majority opinion of the\n259 505 US 833 (1992)\n260 The essential holding of Roe, as summarized in Planned Parenthood, comprised of the following three parts:\n(1) a recognition of a woman's right to choose to have an abortion before foetal viability and to obtain it without\nundue interference from the State, whose pre-viability interests are not strong enough to support an abortion\nprohibition or the imposition of substantial obstacles to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure; (2) a\nconfirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions after viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies\nendangering a woman's life or health; and (3) the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset\nof the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.\n261 525 US 83 (1998)\n155\nPART K\nCourt noting that \u201c[t]he text of the Amendment suggests that its protections extend\nonly to people in \u201ctheir\u201d houses.\u201d The case was distinguished from Minnesota v\nOlson262 (1990), where the Supreme Court decided that an overnight guest in a house\nhad the sort of expectation of privacy that the Fourth Amendment protects. The Court\nwas of the view that while an overnight guest in a home may claim the protection of\nthe Fourth Amendment, one who is merely present with the consent of the\nhouseholder may not. The respondents, in this case, were not overnight guests, but\nwere present for a business transaction and were only in the home for a few hours.\nThe Court held:\n\u201cProperty used for commercial purposes is treated differently\nfor Fourth Amendment purposes from residential property.\n\"An expectation of privacy in commercial premises, however,\nis different from, and indeed less than, a similar expectation in\nan individual's home.\"...\nAnd while it was a \"home\" in which respondents were present, it\nwas not their home\u2026\nthe purely commercial nature of the transaction engaged in here,\nthe relatively short period of time on the premises, and the lack of\nany previous connection between respondents and the\nhouseholder, all lead us to conclude .... any search which may have\noccurred did not violate their Fourth Amendment rights.\u201d (emphasis\nsupplied)\nJustice Ginsburg wrote the dissenting opinion joined by Justice Stevens and Justice\nSouter, and held that:\n\u201cOur decisions indicate that people have a reasonable expectation\nof privacy in their homes in part because they have the prerogative\n262 495 US 91 (1990)\n156\nPART K\nto exclude others\u2026 Through the host\u2019s invitation, the guest gains a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the home. Minnesota v. Olson,\n495 U. S. 91 (1990), so held with respect to an overnight guest. The\nlogic of that decision extends to shorter term guests as well.\u201d\nIn Kyllo v United States263 (2001), the Court held (5:4 majority) that the thermal\nimaging of the house of a person suspected of growing marijuana was a violation of\nthe right to privacy. Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court and held that\nthere is no distinction between \u201coff-the-wall\u201d and \u201cthrough-the-wall\u201d surveillance as\nboth lead to an intrusion into an individual\u2019s privacy:\n\u201cLimiting the prohibition of thermal imaging to \u201cintimate\ndetails\u201d would not only be wrong in principle; it would be\nimpractical in application, failing to provide \u201ca workable\naccommodation between the needs of law enforcement and\nthe interests protected by the Fourth Amendment,\u201d\u2026\nWe\u2026would have to develop a jurisprudence specifying which home\nactivities are \u201cintimate\u201d and which are not. And even when (if ever)\nthat jurisprudence were fully developed, no police officer would be\nable to know in advance whether his through-the-wall surveillance\npicks up \u201cintimate\u201d details\u2013and thus would be unable to know in\nadvance whether it is constitutional\u2026\u201d (emphasis supplied)\nIt was concluded that even though no \u201csignificant\u201d compromise of the homeowner\u2019s\nprivacy had occurred due to the thermal imaging, \u201cthe long view, from the original\nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment\u201d must be taken forward.\n263 533 US 27 (2001)\n157\nPART K\nIn Lawrence v Texas264, the Court in a 6:3 decision struck down the sodomy law in\nTexas and by extension invalidated sodomy laws in 13 other states, making same-\nsex sexual activity legal in every state and territory of the United States. The Court\noverturned its previous ruling on the same issue in the 1986 case, Bowers v\nHardwick265 (1986), where it upheld a challenged Georgia statute and did not find a\nconstitutional protection of sexual privacy. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the\nmajority opinion (6: 3 decision) and held that:\n\u201cThe petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The\nState cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by\nmaking their private sexual conduct a crime\u2026 It is a promise of the\nConstitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the\ngovernment may not enter\u2026 The Texas statute furthers no\nlegitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the\npersonal and private life of the individual.\u201d\nInformational privacy was the core issue in NASA v Nelson266 (2011). The Court held\nunanimously that NASA\u2019s background checks of contract employees did not violate\nany constitutional privacy right. The employees had argued that their constitutional\nright to privacy as envisaged in previous US Supreme Court judgments namely\nWhalen v Roe267 (1977) and Nixon v Administrator of General Services268 (1977),\n264 539 US 558 (2003)\n265 478 US 186 (1986)\n266 562 US 134 (2011)\n267 429 US 589 (1977). In this case, for the first time, the Court explicitly recognized an individual\u2019s interest in\nnondisclosure of information. The Court chose to address the status of privacy in the Constitution, underlining\nthat the constitutional right to privacy remains largely undefined and then identified the types of constitutionally\nprotected privacy interests as follows: \u201cThe cases sometimes characterized as protecting \u2018privacy\u2019 have in fact\ninvolved at least two different kinds of interests. One is the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal\nmatters, and another is the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.\u201d\n268 433 US 425 (1977). In this case, the former President of US, Nixon, was challenging the Presidential\nRecordings and Material Preservation Act, 1974 on the ground that it violated his right of privacy, as there would\n158\nPART K\nwas violated by background checks. The majority judgment delivered by Justice Alito,\ndecided the case assuming that there existed a constitutional right to privacy. The\nCourt held that:\n\u201cWe hold, however, that the challenged portions of the\nGovernment\u2019s background check do not violate this right in the\npresent case. The Government\u2019s interests as employer and\nproprietor in managing its internal operations, combined with the\nprotections against public dissemination provided by the Privacy\nAct of 1974, satisfy any \u201cinterest in avoiding disclosure\u201d that may\n\u201carguably ha[ve] its roots in the Constitution\u2026 The Government has\ngood reason to ask employees about their recent illegal-drug use.\u201d\nThe majority also rejected all the contentions regarding the misuse of collected data\nand held:\n\u201c\u2026 the mere possibility that security measures will fail provides no\n\u201cproper ground\u201d for a broad-based attack on government\ninformation-collection practices. Ibid. Respondents also cite a\nportion of SF\u201385 that warns of possible disclosure \u201c[t]o the news\nmedia or the general public.\u201d App. 89. By its terms, this exception\nallows public disclosure only where release is \u201cin the public\ninterest\u201d and would not result in \u201can unwarranted invasion of\npersonal privacy.\u201d Ibid. Respondents have not cited any\nexample of such a disclosure, nor have they identified any\nplausible scenario in which their information might be unduly\ndisclosed under this exception\u2026 In light of the protection\nprovided by the Privacy Act\u2019s nondisclosure requirement, and\nbecause the challenged portions of the forms consist of\nreasonable inquiries in an employment background check, we\nconclude that the Government\u2019s inquiries do not violate a\nconstitutional right to informational privacy.\u201d (emphasis\nsupplied)\nbe intrusion through the screening of his documents.

The view held\nwas that there exists no constitutional right to informational privacy. Scalia J. criticized\nthe Court's decision to evade the constitutional question, stating that:\n\u201cIf, on the other hand, the Court believes that there is a\nconstitutional right to informational privacy, then I fail to see the\nminimalist virtues in delivering a lengthy opinion analyzing that right\nwhile coyly noting that the right is \u201cassumed\u201d rather than\n\u201cdecided\u201d\u2026 The Court decides that the Government did not\nviolate the right to informational privacy without deciding\nwhether there is a right to informational privacy, and without\neven describing what hypothetical standard should be used to\nassess whether the hypothetical right has been violated.\u201d\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn United States v Jones269 (2012), it was held unanimously that installing a Global\nPositioning System (GPS) tracking device on a vehicle and using the device to monitor\nthe vehicle's movements constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment.\nHowever, the judges were split 5:4 as to the fundamental reasons behind the\nconclusion. Justice Scalia delivered the majority judgment, applying the trespass test.\nIt was held that the Government\u2019s physical intrusion onto the defendant's car for the\npurpose of obtaining information constituted trespass and therefore a \u201csearch\u201d. Justice\n269 565 US 400 (2012)\n160\nPART K\nScalia, however, left unanswered the question surrounding the privacy implications of\na warrantless use of GPS data without physical intrusion.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, concurred with Justice Scalia, but addressed the privacy\naspects of the judgment. Justice Sotomayor agreed with Justice Alito\u2019s concurrence\nthat \u201cphysical intrusion is now unnecessary to many forms of surveillance\u201d, and held\nthat \u201c[i]n cases of electronic or other novel modes of surveillance that do not depend\nupon a physical invasion on property, the majority opinion\u2019s trespassory test may\nprovide little guidance\u201d. It was further observed:\n\u201cGPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive record of a\nperson\u2019s public movements that reflects a wealth of detail about her\nfamilial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.\nDisclosed in [GPS] data\u2026 will be trips the indisputably private\nnature of which takes little imagination to conjure: trips to the\npsychiatrist, the plastic surgeon, the abortion clinic, the AIDS\ntreatment center, the strip club, the criminal defense attorney, the\nby-the-hour motel, the union meeting, the mosque, synagogue or\nchurch, the gay bar and on and on\u2026 The Government can store\nsuch records and efficiently mine them for information years into the\nfuture\u2026 And because GPS monitoring is cheap in comparison to\nconventional surveillance techniques and, by design, proceeds\nsurreptitiously, it evades the ordinary checks that constrain abusive\nlaw enforcement practices: \u201climited police resources and\ncommunity hostility\u201d\u2026\nThe net result is that GPS monitoring\u2014by making available at\na relatively low cost such a substantial quantum of intimate\ninformation about any person whom the Government, in its\nunfettered discretion, chooses to track\u2014may \u201calter the\nrelationship between citizen and government in a way that is\ninimical to democratic society\u201d.\u201d (emphasis supplied)\nJustice Sotomayor concluded, by stating:\n161\nPART K\n\u201c[I] doubt that people would accept without complaint the\nwarrantless disclosure to the Government of a list of every Web site\nthey had visited [or phone numbers dialled]... I would not assume\nthat all information voluntarily disclosed to some member of the\npublic for a limited purpose is, for that reason alone, disentitled to\nFourth Amendment protection.\u201d\nIn Florida v Jardines270 (2013), the Court held that police use of a trained detection\ndog to sniff for narcotics on the front porch of a private home is a \u201csearch\u201d within the\nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, and therefore, without\nconsent, requires both probable cause and a search warrant. Justice Scalia who\ndelivered the opinion of the Court held as follows:\n\u201cWe\u2026 regard the area \u201cimmediately surrounding and\nassociated with the home\u201d\u2014\u2026..as \u201cpart of the home itself for\nFourth Amendment purposes.\u201d \u2026.This area around the home is\n\u201cintimately linked to the home, both physically and\npsychologically,\u201d and is where \u201cprivacy expectations are most\nheightened\u201d.\u201d (emphasis supplied)\nJustice Kagan, in a concurring opinion, wrote:\n\u201cLike the binoculars, a drug-detection dog is a specialized device\nfor discovering objects not in plain view (or plain smell). And as in\nthe hypothetical above, that device was aimed here at a home\u2014\nthe most private and inviolate (or so we expect) of all the\nplaces and things the Fourth Amendment protects\u2026 the\ndevice is not \u201cin general public use,\u201d training it on a home\nviolates our \u201cminimal expectation of privacy\u201d\u2014an expectation\n\u201cthat exists, and that is acknowledged to be reasonable\u201d.\u201d\n(emphasis supplied)\n270 569 US 1 (2013)\n162\nPART K\nThree years ago, in Riley v California271 (2014), the Court unanimously held that the\nwarrantless search and seizure of digital contents of a cell phone during an arrest is\nunconstitutional. Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court and\ncommented on the impact on privacy in an era of cell phones:\n\u201cBefore cell phones, a search of a person was limited by\nphysical realities and tended as a general matter to constitute\nonly a narrow intrusion on privacy...the possible intrusion on\nprivacy is not physically limited in the same way when it comes\nto cell phones\u2026Data on a cell phone can also reveal where a\nperson has been. Historic location information is a standard\nfeature on many smart phones and can reconstruct someone\u2019s\nspecific movements down to the minute, not only around town\nbut also within a particular building\u2026 Mobile application\nsoftware on a cell phone, or \u201capps,\u201d offer a range of tools for\nmanaging detailed information about all aspects of a person\u2019s\nlife\u2026\nModern cell phones are not just another technological\nconvenience. With all they contain and all they may reveal,\nthey hold for many Americans \u201cthe privacies of life\u201d... The fact\nthat technology now allows an individual to carry such\ninformation in his hand does not make the information any less\nworthy of the protection for which the Founders fought. Our\nanswer to the question of what police must do before searching a\ncell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly simple\u2014 get\na warrant.\u201d (emphasis supplied)\nIn Obergefell v Hodges272, the Court held in a 5:4 decision that the fundamental right\nto marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Kennedy authored\nthe majority opinion (joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotamayor and Kagan):\n271 573 US __ (2014)\n272 576 US __ (2015)\n163\nPART K\n\u201cIndeed, the Court has noted it would be contradictory to\nrecognize a right of privacy with respect to other matters of\nfamily life and not with respect to the decision to enter the\nrelationship that is the foundation of the family in our society.\u201d\n(emphasis supplied)\nThe development of the jurisprudence on the right to privacy in the United States of\nAmerica shows that even though there is no explicit mention of the word \u2018privacy\u2019 in\nthe Constitution, the courts of the country have not only recognised the right to privacy\nunder various Amendments of the Constitution but also progressively extended the\nambit of protection under the right to privacy. In its early years, the focus was on\nproperty and protection of physical spaces that would be considered private such as\nan individual\u2019s home. This \u2018trespass doctrine\u2019 became irrelevant when it was held that\nwhat is protected under the right to privacy is \u201cpeople, not places\u201d. The \u2018reasonable\nexpectation of privacy\u2019 test has been relied on subsequently by various other\njurisdictions while developing the right to privacy. Having located the right to privacy\nin the \u2018person\u2019, American jurisprudence on the right to privacy has developed to shield\nvarious private aspects of a person\u2019s life from interference by the state - such as\nconscience, education, personal information, communications and conversations,\nsexuality, marriage, procreation, contraception, individual beliefs, thoughts and\nemotions, political and other social groups. Various judgments of the Court have also\nanalysed technological developments which have made surveillance more pervasive\nand affecting citizens\u2019 privacy. In all these cases, the Court has tried to balance the\ninterests of the individual in maintaining the right to privacy with the interest of the\nState in maintaining law and order. Decisions of the Supreme Court decriminalizing\n164\nPART K\nconsensual sexual activity between homosexuals and guaranteeing same-sex\ncouples the right to marry indicate that the right to privacy is intrinsic to the\nconstitutional guarantees of liberty and equal protection of laws.\n(iii) Constitutional right to privacy in South Africa\nIn South Africa, the right to privacy has been enshrined in Section 14 of the Bill of\nRights in the 1996 Constitution. Section 14 provides that:\n\u201c14. Privacy.-Everyone has the right to privacy, which includes the right\nnot to have-\n(a) their person or home searched;\n(6) their property searched;\n(c) their possessions seized; or\n(d) the privacy of their communications infringed.\u201d\nIn National Media Ltd v Jooste273 (1996), Justice Harms defined privacy in the\nfollowing terms:\n\u201cPrivacy is an individual condition of life characterised by exclusion\nfrom the public and publicity. The condition embraces all those\npersonal facts which a person concerned has determined him to be\nexcluded from the knowledge of outsiders and in respect of which he\nhas the will that they be kept private\u201d\nOn the ambit of the right to privacy, the Court held that:\n\u201cA right to privacy encompasses the competence to determine the\ndestiny of private facts\u2026\nThe individual concerned is entitled to dictate the ambit of disclosure ...\n273 1996 (3) SA 262 (A)\n165\nPART K\nthe purpose and method [of] the disclosure... when and under what\nconditions private facts may be made public. A contrary view will place\nundue constraints upon the individual's so-called \u201cabsolute rights of\npersonality\u201d\u2026\nIt will also mean that rights of personality are of a lower order than real\nor personal rights\u201d.\nIn Bernstein v Bester and Others274 (1996), the South African Supreme Court\ndecided on a challenge to the constitutionality of certain sections of the Companies\nAct, on the ground that examination under these sections violated the general right\nto personal privacy (section 13). It was held that the provisions were not in breach of\nthe Constitution. Justice Ackermann expounded upon the concept of privacy as\nfollows:\n\u201cThe scope of privacy has been closely related to the concept of identity\nand ... [that] the right\u2026 [is] based on a notion of the unencumbered\nself, but on the notion of what is necessary to have one\u2019s own\nautonomous identity\u201d.\nThe Court observed that like every other right, the right to privacy also has its limits:\n\u201c[67] In the context of privacy it is only the inner sanctum of a person,\nsuch as his/her family life, sexual preference and home environment,\nwhich is shielded from erosion by conflicting rights of the community.\nThis implies that community rights and the rights of fellow members\nplace a corresponding obligation on a citizen, thereby shaping the\nabstract notion of individualism towards identifying a concrete member\nof civil society. Privacy is acknowledged in the truly personal realm, but\nas a person moves into communal relations and activities such as\nbusiness and social interaction, the scope of personal space shrinks\naccordingly.\u201d\n274 1996 (2) SA 751 (CC)\n166\nPART K\nThe constitutional validity of laws making sodomy an offence was challenged in\nNational Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice275 (1999).\nIt was held that the common law offence of sodomy was inconsistent with the\nConstitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. Ackermann J. described how\ndiscrimination leads to invasion of privacy and held that:\n\u201cPrivacy recognises that we all have a right to a sphere of private\nintimacy and autonomy which allows us to establish and nurture human\nrelationships without interference from the outside community. The way\nin which we give expression to our sexuality is at the core of this area\nof private intimacy. If, in expressing our sexuality, we act consensually\nand without harming one another, invasion of that precinct will be a\nbreach of our privacy\u2026\u201d\nSachs J. discussed the interrelation between equality and privacy and held that:\n\u201c...equality and privacy cannot be separated, because they are both\nviolated simultaneously by anti-sodomy laws. In the present matter,\nsuch laws deny equal respect for difference, which lies at the heart of\nequality, and become the basis for the invasion of privacy. At the same\ntime, the negation by the state of different forms of intimate personal\nbehaviour becomes the foundation for the repudiation of equality.\u201d\nOn the meaning of \u2018autonomy\u2019, the Court observed that:\n\u201cAutonomy must mean far more than the right to occupy an\nenvelope of space in which a socially detached individual can act\nfreely from interference by the state. What is crucial is the nature\nof the activity, not its site. While recognising the unique worth of each\nperson, the Constitution does not presuppose that a holder of rights\nis as an isolated, lonely and abstract figure possessing a disembodied\nand socially disconnected self. It acknowledges that people live in\ntheir bodies, their communities, their cultures, their places and\ntheir times. ...It is not for the state to choose or to arrange the choice\n275 1999 (1) SA 6 (CC)\n167\nPART K\nof partner, but for the partners to choose themselves.\u201d (emphasis\nsupplied)\nJustice Sachs noted that the motif which links and unites equality and privacy, and\nwhich runs right through the protections offered by the Bill of Rights, is dignity.\nIn Investigating Directorate: Serious Offences v Hyundai Motor Distributors\nLtd276 (2001), the Court was concerned with the constitutionality of the provisions of\nthe National Prosecuting Authority Act that authorised the issuing of warrants of\nsearch and seizure for purposes of a \u201cpreparatory investigation\u201d.\nLanga J. delivered judgment on the right to privacy of juristic persons and held that:\n\u201c... privacy is a right which becomes more intense the closer it moves\nto the intimate personal sphere of the life of human beings, and less\nintense as it moves away from that core. This understanding of the right\nflows... from the value placed on human dignity by the Constitution.\nJuristic persons are not the bearers of human dignity. Their privacy\nrights, therefore, can never be as intense as those of human beings.\nHowever, this does not mean that juristic persons are not protected by\nthe right to privacy. Exclusion of juristic persons would lead to the\npossibility of grave violations of privacy in our society, with serious\nimplications for the conduct of affairs.\u201d\nHighlighting the need to balance interests of the individual and the State, it was held\nthat:\n\u201c[54] ...Search and seizure provisions, in the context of a preparatory\ninvestigation, serve an important purpose in the fight against crime.\nThat the state has a pressing interest which involves the security and\nfreedom of the community as a whole is beyond question. It is an\nobjective which is sufficiently important to justify the limitation of the\n276 2001 (1) SA 545 (CC)\n168\nPART K\nright to privacy of an individual in certain circumstances\u2026.On the other\nhand, state officials are not entitled without good cause to invade the\npremises of persons for purposes of searching and seizing property;\n...A balance must therefore be struck between the interests of the\nindividual and that of the state, a task that lies at the heart of the\ninquiry into the limitation of rights.\u201d (emphasis supplied)\nIn Minister of Home Affairs and Another v Fourie and Another277 (2006), the\nConstitutional Court of South Africa ruled unanimously that same-sex couples have a\nconstitutional right to marry. The judgment delivered by Justice Sachs, held that:\n\u201cSection 9(1) of the Constitution provides: \u201cEveryone is equal before\nthe law and has the right to equal protection and benefit of the law.\u201d...\nSections 9(1) and 9(3) cannot be read as merely protecting same-sex\ncouples from punishment or stigmatisation. They also go beyond\nsimply preserving a private space in which gay and lesbian\ncouples may live together without interference from the state.\nIndeed, what the applicants in this matter seek is not the right to\nbe left alone, but the right to be acknowledged as equals and to\nbe embraced with dignity by the law\u2026\nIt is demeaning to adoptive parents to suggest that their family is\nany less a family and any less entitled to respect and concern than\na family with procreated children. It is even demeaning of a couple\nwho voluntarily decide not to have children or sexual relations\nwith one another; this being a decision entirely within their\nprotected sphere of freedom and privacy...\u201d (emphasis supplied)\nIn NM and Others v Smith and Others278 (2007), the names of three women who\nwere HIV positive were disclosed in a biography. They alleged that the publication,\nwithout their prior consent, violated their rights to privacy, dignity and psychological\nintegrity. The Court by majority held that the respondents were aware that the\napplicants had not given their express consent but had published their names, thereby\n277 2006 (1) SA 524 (CC).\n278 2007 (5) SA 250 (CC).\n169\nPART K\nviolating their privacy and dignity rights. Justice Madala delivered the majority\njudgment on the basis of the value of privacy and confidentiality in medical information\nand held that:\n\u201cPrivate and confidential medical information contains highly sensitive\nand personal information about individuals. The personal and intimate\nnature of an individual\u2019s health information, unlike other forms of\ndocumentation, reflects delicate decisions and choices relating to\nissues pertaining to bodily and psychological integrity and personal\nautonomy\u2026\nIndividuals value the privacy of confidential medical information\nbecause of the vast number of people who could have access to the\ninformation and the potential harmful effects that may result from\ndisclosure. The lack of respect for private medical information and its\nsubsequent disclosure may result in fear jeopardising an individual\u2019s\nright to make certain fundamental choices that he/she has a right to\nmake. There is therefore a strong privacy interest in maintaining\nconfidentiality.\u201d\nThe decision of the Court was that there must be a pressing social need for the right\nto privacy to be interfered with and that there was no such compelling public interest\nin this case.\nIn the dissenting opinion, Justice O\u2019Regan held that the publication of the names and\nHIV status of the women was neither intentional nor negligent. In that view, the\nrespondents had assumed that consent was given because the applicants\u2019 names\nand HIV status were published in a publication, with no disclaimer regarding their\nconsent to the contrary. While elaborating on the constitutional right of privacy, the\nCourt held that:\n\u201c... although as human beings we live in a community and are in a\nreal sense both constituted by and constitutive of that community,\n170\nPART K\nwe are nevertheless entitled to a personal sphere from which we\nmay and do exclude that community. In that personal sphere, we\nestablish and foster intimate human relationships and live our daily\nlives. This sphere in which to pursue our own ends and interests in\nour own ways, although often mundane, is intensely important to\nwhat makes human life meaningful.\u201d\nAccording to the decision, there are two inter-related reasons for the constitutional\nprotection of privacy- one flows from the \u201cconstitutional conception of what it means\nto be a human being\u201d and the second from the \u201cconstitutional conception of the state\u201d:\n\u201cAn implicit part of [the first] aspect of privacy is the right to choose\nwhat personal information of ours is released into the public space.\nThe more intimate that information, the more important it is in\nfostering privacy, dignity and autonomy that an individual\nmakes the primary decision whether to release the\ninformation. That decision should not be made by others. This\naspect of the right to privacy must be respected by all of us, not only\nthe state.\n\u2026Secondly, we value privacy as a necessary part of a\ndemocratic society and as a constraint on the power of the\nstate... In authoritarian societies, the state generally does not afford\nsuch protection. People and homes are often routinely searched\nand the possibility of a private space from which the state can be\nexcluded is often denied. The consequence is a denial of liberty and\nhuman dignity. In democratic societies, this is impermissible.\u201d\n(emphasis supplied)\nThe limits of the right to privacy and the need to balance it with other rights emerge\nfrom the following observations:\n\u201cRecognition of legitimate limits on the inviolability of personal\nspace, however, does not mean that the space is not worthy of\nprotection. The Constitution seeks to ensure that rights reinforce\none another in a constructive manner in order to promote human\nrights generally. At times our Constitution recognises that a balance\nhas to be found to provide protection for the different rights.\u201d\n171\nPART K\nOn the inter-relationship between the right to privacy, liberty and dignity, the Court\nobserved that:\n\u201cThe right to privacy recognises the importance of protecting the\nsphere of our personal daily lives from the public. In so doing, it\nhighlights the inter-relationship between privacy, liberty and\ndignity as the key constitutional rights which construct our\nunderstanding of what it means to be a human being. All these\nrights are therefore inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing.\nWe value privacy for this reason at least \u2013 that the constitutional\nconception of being a human being asserts and seeks to foster the\npossibility of human beings choosing how to live their lives within\nthe overall framework of a broader community.\u201d (emphasis\nsupplied)\nThe interim as well as the Final Constitution of South Africa contain explicit provisions\nguaranteeing the right to privacy. The Judges of South African Supreme Court have\ngiven an expansive meaning to the right, making significant inter-linkages between\nequality, privacy and dignity. In doing so, it has been acknowledged that the right to\nprivacy does not exist in a vacuum, its contravention having a significant bearing on\nother citizen rights as well. Such an interpretation may prove to have a catalytic effect\non a country transitioning from an apartheid state to a democratic nation.\n(iv) Constitutional right to privacy in Canada\nAlthough the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms of 1982 (\u201cthe Charter\u201d) does\nnot explicitly provide for a right to privacy, certain sections of the Charter have been\nrelied on by the Supreme Court of Canada to recognize a right to privacy. Most\n172\nPART K\nnotably, Section 8279 (the Canadian version of the Fourth Amendment of the US\nConstitution) has been employed in this respect. Privacy issues have also been\nrecognized in respect of Section 7280 of the Charter. In 1983, the Privacy Act was\nenacted to regulate how federal government collects, uses and discloses personal\ninformation.281 The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act\n(PIPEDA) governs how private sector organisations collect, use and disclose personal\ninformation in the course of commercial activities\nOne of the landmark cases on the right to privacy was Hunter v Southam Inc282\n(1984). This was also the first Supreme Court of Canada decision to consider Section\n8 of the Charter. In this case, the Combines Investigation Act had authorized several\ncivil servants to enter the offices of Southam Inc and examine documents. The\ncompany claimed that this Act violated Section 8 of the Canadian Charter. The Court\nunanimously held that the Combines Investigation Act violated the Charter as it did\nnot provide an appropriate standard for administering warrants.\nDickson J. wrote the opinion of the Court and observed that the Canadian Charter is\na \u201cpurposive document\u201d whose purpose is to \u201cguarantee and to protect, within the\nlimits of reason, the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms it enshrines\u201d and to\n279 Section 8 of the Charter provides as follows: \u201cEveryone has the right to be secure against unreasonable\nsearch or seizure.\u201d\n280 Section 7 of the Canadian Charter deals with life, liberty and security of person and states that: \u201cEveryone has\nthe right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance\nwith the principles of fundamental justice.\u201d\n281 In Lavigne v. Canada (Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages), [2002] 2 SCR 773, the Supreme\nCourt of Canada recognised the Privacy Act as having a \"quasi-constitutional\" status, as it is \u201cclosely linked to\nthe values and rights set out in the Constitution\u201d. The Court also stated that the \"The Privacy Act is a reminder\nof the extent to which the protection of privacy is necessary to the preservation of a free and democratic society\u201d.\n282 [1984] 2 SCR 145\n173\nPART K\nconstrain governmental action inconsistent with those rights and freedoms. The Court\nheld that since Section 8 is an entrenched constitutional provision, it was \u201cnot\nvulnerable to encroachment by legislative enactments in the same way as common\nlaw protections.\u201d\nThe Court held that the purpose of Section 8 is to protect an individual's reasonable\nexpectation of privacy but right to privacy must be balanced against the government\u2019s\nduty to enforce the law. It was further held that:\n\u201cThe guarantee of security from unreasonable search and seizure only\nprotects a reasonable expectation. This limitation on the right\nguaranteed by s. 8, whether it is expressed negatively as freedom from\n\"unreasonable\" search and seizure, or positively as an entitlement to a\n\"reasonable\" expectation of privacy, indicates that an assessment must\nbe made as to whether in a particular situation the public's interest in\nbeing left alone by government must give way to the government's\ninterest in intruding on the individual's privacy in order to advance its\ngoals, notably those of law enforcement.\u201d\nIn Her Majesty, The Queen v Brandon Roy Dyment283 (1988), a patient had met\nwith an accident on a highway. A doctor collected a sample of blood from his wound.\nThe blood sample was taken for medical purposes but was given to a police officer.\nAs a result of an analysis carried out by the police officer, the patient was charged\nwith impaired driving. The Court held that the seizing of blood taken for medical\npurposes was a violation of Section 8 of the Charter and that the spirit of the Charter\n\u201cmust not be constrained by narrow legalistic classifications based on notions of\nproperty\u201d. It was further held:\n283 [1988] 2 SCR 417\n174\nPART K\n\u201c[L]egal claims to privacy in this sense were largely confined to the\nhome. But\u2026 [t]o protect privacy only in the home ... is to shelter\nwhat has become, in modern society, only a small part of the\nindividual's daily environmental need for privacy...\nPrivacy is at the heart of liberty in a modern state...Grounded in\nman's physical and moral autonomy, privacy is essential for the\nwell-being of the individual. For this reason alone, it is worthy of\nconstitutional protection, but it also has profound significance for\nthe public order. The restraints imposed on government to pry\ninto the lives of the citizen go to the essence of a democratic\nstate.\u201d (emphasis supplied)\nOn the importance of informational privacy, it was held:\n\u201cThis notion of privacy derives from the assumption that all\ninformation about a person is in a fundamental way his own, for him\nto communicate or retain for himself as he sees fit...\nIn modern society, especially, retention of information about oneself\nis extremely important. We may, for one reason or another, wish or\nbe compelled to reveal such information, but situations abound\nwhere the reasonable expectations of the individual that the\ninformation shall remain confidential to the persons to whom, and\nrestricted to the purposes for which it is divulged, must be\nprotected.\u201d\nJustice La Forest wrote on the importance of consent and held that \u201cthe use of a\nperson's body without his consent to obtain information about him, invades an area of\npersonal privacy essential to the maintenance of his human dignity.\u201d\nThe Court found that the patient had a \u201cwell-founded\u201d and \u201creasonable\u201d expectation\nof privacy that his blood sample, collected by the doctor, would be used for medical\npurposes only and that such expectation \u201cis intended to protect people not things\u201d. It\nwas held that:\n175\nPART K\n\u201cIn the present case, however, the respondent may, for some\npurposes perhaps, be deemed to have impliedly consented to a\nsample being taken for medical purposes, but he retained an\nexpectation that his privacy interest in the sample continue past the\ntime of its taking\u2026Under these circumstances, the sample was\nsurrounded by an aura of privacy meriting Charter protection. For\nthe state to take it in violation of a patient's right to privacy\nconstitutes a seizure for the purposes of s. 8.\u201d\nR v Plant284 (1993) is a leading decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on the\nprotection of personal information under the Charter. In this case, a police officer, on\nthe basis of information that marijuana was being grown in an area, accessed the\nelectrical utility\u2019s computer system and discovered that a particular house was\nconsuming an extremely high amount of electricity. Two officers then performed a\nwarrantless perimeter search of the property and observed that the basement\nwindows were covered with something opaque and a that a vent had been blocked\nusing a plastic bag. On the basis of this information, the police obtained a warrant to\nsearch the home and discovered over a hundred seedling marijuana plants. The\naccused was charged with cultivation of marijuana and possession for the purpose of\ntrafficking. The issue was whether the warrantless perimeter search of his home and\nthe seizure of electricity consumption records violated his right against unreasonable\nsearch and seizure under section 8 of the Charter.\n284 [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281\n176\nPART K\nThe judgment delivered by Justice Sopinka relied on a part of the United States v\nMiller285 decision, that in order to be constitutionally protected the information must\nbe of a \u201cpersonal and confidential\u201d nature and held that:\n\u201cIn fostering the underlying values of dignity, integrity and autonomy, it\nis fitting that s. 8 of the Charter should seek to protect a biographical\ncore of personal information which individuals in a free and democratic\nsociety would wish to maintain and control from dissemination to the\nstate. This would include information which tends to reveal intimate\ndetails of the lifestyle and personal choices of the individual.\u201d\nThe Court held that the perimeter search violated the Charter and that the seizure of\nconsumption records was not in violation of Section 8. This decision was based on\nthe ground that the pattern of electricity consumption revealed as a result of computer\ninvestigations could not be said to reveal intimate details since \u201celectricity\nconsumption reveals very little about the personal lifestyle or private decisions.\u201d\nIn Her Majesty, The Queen v Walter Tessling286 (2004), the Supreme Court of\nCanada held that the use of thermal imaging by the police in the course of an\ninvestigation of a suspect's property did not constitute a violation of the accused's\nright to a reasonable expectation of privacy under Section 8 of the Canadian Charter.\nOn the reasonable expectation of privacy, it was held that the totality of circumstances\nneed to be considered with particular emphasis on both the existence of a subjective\nexpectation of privacy, and the objective reasonableness of the expectation. The\nCourt ruled that the cases of privacy interests (protected by S. 8 of the Canadian\n285 425 US 435 (1976)\n286 (2004) SCC 67\n177\nPART K\nCharter) need to be distinguished between personal privacy, territorial privacy and\ninformational privacy.\u201d\nThe Court relied on Justice Sopinka\u2019s understanding of the scope of the protection of\ninformational privacy in R v Plant (supra) and held that the information generated by\nFLIR imaging did not reveal a \u201cbiographical core of personal information\u201d or \u201cintimate\ndetails of [his] lifestyle\u201d, and therefore section 8 had not been violated.\nThe decision in R v Spencer287 (2014) was related to informational privacy. In this\ncase, the appellant used an online software to download child pornography onto a\ncomputer and shared it publicly. The police requested subscriber information\nassociated with an IP address from the appellant\u2019s Internet Service Provider and on\nthe basis of it, searched the computer used by him. The Canadian Supreme Court\nunanimously ruled that the request for an IP address infringed the Charter's guarantee\nagainst unreasonable search and seizure. It was held that the appellant had a\nreasonable expectation of privacy. In doing so, it assessed whether there is a\n\u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d in the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d, which\nincludes \u201cthe nature of the privacy interests implicated by the state action\u201d and \u201cfactors\nmore directly concerned with the expectation of privacy, both subjectively and\nobjectively viewed, in relation to those interests\u201d. It was further held:\n\u201c...factors that may be considered in assessing the reasonable\nexpectation of privacy can be grouped under four main headings for\nanalytical convenience: (1) the subject matter of the alleged\nsearch; (2) the claimant's interest in the subject matter; (3) the\nclaimant's subjective expectation of privacy in the subject\n287 (2014) SCC 43\n178\nPART K\nmatter; and (4) whether this subjective expectation of privacy\nwas objectively reasonable, having regard to the totality of the\ncircumstances.\u201d (emphasis supplied)\nThe issue in the case was whether there is a privacy interest in subscriber information\nwith respect to computers used in homes for private purposes. The Court applied a\nbroad approach in understanding the online privacy interests and held that:\n\u201cPrivacy is admittedly a \"broad and somewhat evanescent concept\"...\n[T]he Court has described three broad types of privacy interests -\nterritorial, personal, and informational - which, while often overlapping,\nhave proved helpful in identifying the nature of the privacy interest or\ninterests at stake in particular situations\u2026\u201d\nThe Court found that the nature of appellant\u2019s privacy interest in subscriber\ninformation relating to a computer used privately was primarily an informational\none and held:\n\u201c... the identity of a person linked to their use of the Internet must be\nrecognized as giving rise to a privacy interest beyond that inherent in\nthe person\u2019s name, address and telephone number found in the\nsubscriber information.\u201d\nIt then set out three key elements of informational privacy: privacy as secrecy,\nprivacy as control, and privacy as anonymity. It further emphasised on the\nimportance of anonymity in informational privacy, particularly in the age of the\nInternet and held that:\n\u201c... anonymity may, depending on the totality of the circumstances, be\nthe foundation of a privacy interest that engages constitutional\nprotection against unreasonable search and seizure...\u201d\n179\nPART K\nThough the Court stopped short of recognizing an absolute right to anonymity, it held\nthat \u201canonymous Internet activity engages a high level of informational privacy\u201d. The\nCourt further held that:\n\u201cThe disclosure of this information will often amount to the identification\nof a user with intimate or sensitive activities being carried out online,\nusually on the understanding that these activities would be anonymous.\nA request by a police officer that an ISP voluntarily disclose such\ninformation amounts to a search.\u201d\nThe Canadian Supreme Court has used provisions of the Charter to expand the\nscope of the right to privacy, used traditionally to protect individuals from an invasion\nof their property rights, to an individual\u2019s \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d. The\nright to privacy has been held to be more than just a physical right as it includes the\nprivacy in information about one\u2019s identity. Informational privacy has frequently been\naddressed under Section 8 of the Charter. Canadian privacy jurisprudence has\ndeveloped with the advent of technology and the internet. Judicial decisions have\nsignificant implications for internet/digital privacy.\n(v) Privacy under The European Convention on Human Rights and the European Charter\nIn Europe, there are two distinct but related frameworks to ensure the protection of\nthe right of privacy. The first is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR),\nan international agreement to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in\nEurope. The second is the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union\n(CFREU), a treaty enshrining certain political, social, and economic rights for the\n180\nPART K\nEuropean Union. Under ECHR (\u201cthe Convention\u201d), the European Court of Human\nRights (ECtHR), also known as the \u2018Strasbourg Court\u2019, is the adjudicating body, which\nhears complaints by individuals on alleged breaches of human rights by signatory\nstates. Similarly, under CFREU (\u201cthe Charter), the Court of Justice of the European\nUnion (CJEU), also called the \u2018Luxembourg Court\u2019, is the chief judicial authority of the\nEuropean Union and oversees the uniform application and interpretation of European\nUnion law, in co-operation with the national judiciary of the member states.\nArticle 8 of the ECHR provides that:\n\u201cRight to respect for private and family life\n1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his\nhome and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise\nof this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is\nnecessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security,\npublic safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the\nprevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,\nor for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\nUnder the Charter, the relevant provisions are:\nArticle 7\nRespect for private and family life\nEveryone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life,\nhome and communications.\nArticle 8\nProtection of personal data\n1. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning\nhim or her.\n181\nPART K\n2. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on\nthe basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other\nlegitimate basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to\ndata which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to\nhave it rectified.\n3. Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an\nindependent authority.\nArticle 52\nScope of guaranteed rights\n1. Any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised\nby this Charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of\nthose rights and freedoms. Subject to the principle of proportionality,\nlimitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet\nobjectives of general interests recognised by the Union of the need to\nprotect the rights and freedoms of others.\n2. Rights recognised by this Charter which are based on the\nCommunity Treaties or the Treaty on European Union shall be\nexercised under the conditions and within the limits defined by those\nTreaties.\n3. In so far as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights\nguaranteed by the Convention of the Protection of Human Rights and\nFundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those rights shall\nbe the same as those laid down by the said Convention. This provision\nshall not prevent Union law providing more extensive protection.\nArticle 52(3) provides for the ECHR as a minimum standard of human rights in the\nEU. Article 52(3) thus leads the EU to be indirectly bound by the ECHR as it must\nalways be obeyed when restricting fundamental rights in the EU. Moreover, in the pre-\nCharter era, the protection of privacy was held to form part of the right to privacy in\nline with how the ECtHR in Strasbourg interprets Art. 8 of ECHR till date288.\n288 In the case of J McB v LE, Case C-400/10 PPU, [2010] ECR I-nyr, the CJEU ruled that where Charter rights\nparalleled ECHR rights, the Court of Justice should follow any consistent jurisprudence of the European Court of\nHuman Rights, elucidating that: \u201cIt is clear that the said Article 7 [of the EU Charter] contains rights corresponding\nto those guaranteed by Article 8(1) of the ECHR. Article 7 of the Charter must therefore be given the same\nmeaning and the same scope as Article 8(1) of the ECHR...\u201d Reference can be passed to a case before ECtHR,\n182\nPART K\nThus, in order to understand the protection extended to the right to privacy in EU, the\njurisprudence of Article 8 of the Convention and Article 7 of the Charter need to be\nanalyzed. The term \u2018private life\u2019 is an essential ingredient of both these provisions and\nhas been interpreted to encompass a wide range of interests.\nIn the case of Niemietz v Germany289 (1992), the ECtHR observed that:\n\u201cThe Court does not consider it possible or necessary to attempt an\nexhaustive definition of the notion of \"private life\". However, it would be\ntoo restrictive to limit the notion to an \"inner circle\" in which the\nindividual may live his own personal life as he chooses and to exclude\ntherefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle.\nRespect for private life must also comprise to a certain degree the right\nto establish and develop relationships with other human beings.\u201d\nSimilarly, in Costello-Roberts v United Kingdom290 (1993), the ECtHR stated that\n\u201cthe notion of \"private life\" is a broad one\u201d and \u201cis not susceptible to exhaustive\ndefinition\u201d.\nThis broad approach is also present in the recent cases of European jurisprudence.\nIn S and Marper v United Kingdom291 (2008), the ECtHR held, with respect to right\nto respect for private life, that :\n\u201c...the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d... covers the physical and psychological\nintegrity of a person... It can therefore embrace multiple aspects of the\nperson's physical and social identity... Elements such as, for example,\ngender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall\nwithin the personal sphere protected by Article 8... Beyond a person's\nVarec SA v. \u00c9tat belge, Case C-450/06, [2008] ECR I-581, where it was observed that that: \u201c...the right to respect\nfor private life, enshrined in Article 8 of the ECHR, which flows from the common constitutional traditions of the\nMember States.... is restated in Article 7 of the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union\u201d.\n289 Application no. 13710/88, judgment dated 16 September 1992.\n290 Application no. 13134/87, judgment dated 25 March 1993.\n291 [2008] ECHR 1581\n183\nPART K\nname, his or her private and family life may include other means of\npersonal identification and of linking to a family... Information about the\nperson's health is an important element of private life... The Court\nfurthermore considers that an individual's ethnic identity must be\nregarded as another such element... The concept of private life\nmoreover includes elements relating to a person's right to their\nimage\u2026\u201d\nIn Uzun v Germany292 (2010), the European Court of Human Rights while examining\nan application claiming violation of Article 8 observed that:\n\u201cArticle 8 protects, inter alia, a right to identity and personal\ndevelopment, and the right to establish and develop relationships with\nother human beings and the outside world. There is, therefore, a zone\nof interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which\nmay fall within the scope of \u201cprivate life\u201d...\nThere are a number of elements relevant to a consideration of whether\na person's private life is concerned by measures effected outside a\nperson's home or private premises. Since there are occasions when\npeople knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activities which\nare or may be recorded or reported in a public manner, a person's\nreasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, although\nnot necessarily conclusive, factor\u2026\u201d\nThus, the determination of a complaint by an individual under Article 8 of the Convention\nnecessarily involves a two-stage test293, which can be summarized as below:\n\u201cStage 1: Article 8 para. 1\n1.1 Does the complaint fall within the scope of one of the rights\nprotected by Article 8 para 1?\n1.2 If so, is there a positive obligation on the State to respect an\nindividual\u2019s right and has it been fulfilled?\nStage 2: Article 8 para. 2\n2.1 Has there been an interference with the Article 8 right?\n2.2 If so,\n292 Application No. 35623/05\n293 Ursula Kilkelly, \u201cThe right to respect for private and family life: A guide to the implementation of Article 8 of the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights\u201d, Council of Europe (2001), at page 9\n184\nPART K\n2.2.1 is it in accordance with law?\n2.2.2 does it pursue a legitimate aim?\n2.2.3 is it necessary in a democratic society?\nThis test is followed by the Court each time it applies Article 8 in a\ngiven case.\u201d\nIn other words, a fair balance is struck between the general interest of the community\nand the interests of the individual.\nThe Grand Chamber of 18 judges at the ECtHR, in S and Marper v United Kingdom\n(supra), examined the claim of the applicants that their Right to Respect for Private\nLife under Article 8 was being violated as their fingerprints, cell samples and DNA\nprofiles were retained in a database after successful termination of criminal\nproceedings against them. The Court held that there had been a violation of Article 8\nof the Convention. Finding that the retention at issue had constituted a\ndisproportionate interference with the applicants\u2019 right to respect for private life, the\nCourt held that \u201cthe blanket and indiscriminate nature of the powers of retention of the\nfingerprints, cellular samples and DNA profiles of persons...fails to strike a fair balance\nbetween the competing public and private interests and that the respondent State has\noverstepped any acceptable margin of appreciation\u201d. It was further held that:\n\u201cThe mere storing of data relating to the private life of an individual\namounts to an interference within the meaning of Article 8. However,\nin determining whether the personal information retained by the\nauthorities involves any of the private-life aspects mentioned above,\nthe Court will have due regard to the specific context in which the\ninformation at issue has been recorded and retained, the nature of the\nrecords, the way in which these records are used and processed and\nthe results that may be obtained.\u201d\n185\nPART K\nApplying the above principles, it was held that:\n\u201cThe Court notes at the outset that all three categories of the personal\ninformation retained by the authorities in the present cases, namely\nfingerprints, DNA profiles and cellular samples, constitute personal\ndata within the meaning of the Data Protection Convention as they\nrelate to identified or identifiable individuals. The Government accepted\nthat all three categories are \u201cpersonal data\u201d within the meaning of the\nData Protection Act 1998 in the hands of those who are able to identify\nthe individual.\u201d\nRegarding the retention of cellular samples and DNA profiles, it was held that:\n\u201cGiven the nature and the amount of personal information contained in\ncellular samples, their retention per se must be regarded as interfering\nwith the right to respect for the private lives of the individuals\nconcerned. That only a limited part of this information is actually\nextracted or used by the authorities through DNA profiling and that no\nimmediate detriment is caused in a particular case does not change\nthis conclusion\u2026 [T]he DNA profiles' capacity to provide a means of\nidentifying genetic relationships between individuals\u2026 is in itself\nsufficient to conclude that their retention interferes with the right to the\nprivate life of the individuals concerned... The possibility the DNA\nprofiles create for inferences to be drawn as to ethnic origin makes their\nretention all the more sensitive and susceptible of affecting the right to\nprivate life.\u201d\nRegarding retention of fingerprints, it was held that:\n\u201c...fingerprints objectively contain unique information about the\nindividual concerned allowing his or her identification with precision in\na wide range of circumstances.

In this case, the applicant was\nsuspected of involvement in bomb attacks by the left-wing extremist movement. The\nCourt unanimously concluded that there had been no violation of Article 8 and held\nas follows:\n\u201cGPS surveillance of Mr Uzun had been ordered to investigate several\ncounts of attempted murder for which a terrorist movement had claimed\nresponsibility and to prevent further bomb attacks. It therefore served\nthe interests of national security and public safety, the prevention of\ncrime and the protection of the rights of the victims. It had only been\nordered after less intrusive methods of investigation had proved\ninsufficient, for a relatively short period of time \u2013 three months \u2013 and it\nhad affected Mr Uzun only when he was travelling with his accomplice\u2019s\ncar. Therefore, he could not be said to have been subjected to total and\ncomprehensive surveillance. Given that the investigation concerned\nvery serious crimes, the Court found that the GPS surveillance of Mr\nUzun had been proportionate.\u201d\nThe decision of the CJEU in the case Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Establecimientos\nFinancieros de Cr\u00e9dito (ASNEF) v Spain294 relied upon the Article 7 right to respect\nfor private life and Article 8(1) of the Charter to find that the implementation in Spain\nof the Data Protection Directive was defective in that it applied only to information kept\nin a specified public data bank rather than more generally to public and private\ndatabases, on the basis that \u201cthe processing of data appearing in non-public sources\nnecessarily implies that information relating to the data subject\u2019s private life will\nthereafter be known by the data controller and, as the case may be, by the third party\nor parties to whom the data is disclosed. This more serious infringement of the data\n294 C-468/10, 24 November, [2011] ECR I-nyr\n187\nPART K\nsubject\u2019s rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter must be properly taken\ninto account\u201d.\nIn Digital Rights Ireland Ltd v Minister295 (2014), the CJEU examined the validity of\na Data Protection Directive, which required telephone and internet service providers\nto retain details of internet and call data for 6 to 24 months, as well as related data\nnecessary to identify the subscriber or user, so as to ensure that the data is available\nfor the purpose of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of serious\ncrimes. The Court ruled that the Directive is incompatible with Article 52(1) of the\nCharter, because the limitations which the said Directive placed were \u201cnot\naccompanied by the necessary principles for governing the guarantees needed to\nregulate access to the data and their use\u201d. It was held that:\n\u201cTo establish the existence of an interference with the fundamental\nright to privacy, it does not matter whether the information on the private\nlives concerned is sensitive or whether the persons concerned have\nbeen inconvenienced in any way.\u201d\nWhile stating that data relating to the use of electronic communications is particularly\nimportant and therefore a valuable tool in the prevention of offences and the fight\nagainst crime, in particular organised crime, the Court looked into the proportionality\nof the interference with the right to privacy and held that:\n\u201cAs regards the necessity for the retention of data required by Directive\n2006/24, it must be held that the fight against serious crime, in\nparticular against organised crime and terrorism, is indeed of the\nutmost importance in order to ensure public security and its\n295 C-293/12\n188\nPART K\neffectiveness may depend to a great extent on the use of modern\ninvestigation techniques. However, such an objective of general\ninterest, however fundamental it may be, does not, in itself, justify a\nretention measure such as that established by Directive 2006/24 being\nconsidered to be necessary for the purpose of that fight...\u201d\nHighlighting that the said Directive does not provide for sufficient safeguards, it was\nheld that by adopting the Directive, the EU \u201cexceeded the limits imposed by\ncompliance with the principle of proportionality in the light of Articles 7, 8 and 52(1) of\nthe Charter.\u201d\nIn RE v The United Kingdom296 (2015), the applicant was arrested and detained on\nthree occasions in relation to the murder of a police officer. He claimed violation of\nArticle 8 under the regime of covert surveillance of consultations between detainees\nand their lawyers, medical advisors and appropriate adults297 sanctioned by the\nexisting law. The ECtHR held that:\n\u201cThe Court\u2026considers that the surveillance of a legal consultation\nconstitutes an extremely high degree of intrusion into a person\u2019s right\nto respect for his or her private life and correspondence...\nConsequently, in such cases it will expect the same safeguards to be\nin place to protect individuals from arbitrary interference with their\nArticle 8 rights...\nSurveillance of \u201cappropriate adult\u201d-detainee consultations were not\nsubject to legal privilege and therefore a detainee would not have the\nsame expectation of privacy.\u2026The relevant domestic provisions,\ninsofar as they related to the possible surveillance of consultations\nbetween detainees and \u201cappropriate adults\u201d, were accompanied by\n\u201cadequate safeguards against abuse\u201d, notably as concerned the\nauthorisation, review and record keeping. Hence, there is no violation\nof Article 8.\u201d\n296 Application No. 62498/11\n297 As per the facts of the case, an \u201cappropriate adults\u201d could be a relative or guardian, or a person experienced\nin dealing with mentally disordered or mentally vulnerable people.\n189\nPART K\nIn Roman Zakharov v Russia298 (2015), ECtHR examined an application claiming\nviolation of Article 8 of the Convention alleging that the mobile operators had permitted\nunrestricted interception of all telephone communications by the security services\nwithout prior judicial authorisation, under the prevailing national law. The Court\nobserved that:\n\u201cMr Zakharov was entitled to claim to be a victim of a violation of the\nEuropean Convention, even though he was unable to allege that he\nhad been the subject of a concrete measure of surveillance. Given the\nsecret nature of the surveillance measures provided for by the\nlegislation, their broad scope (affecting all users of mobile telephone\ncommunications) and the lack of effective means to challenge them at\nnational level\u2026 Russian law did not meet the \u201cquality of law\u201d\nrequirement and was incapable of keeping the interception of\ncommunications to what was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.\nThere had accordingly been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\u201d\nBoth the ECtHR and the CJEU, while dealing with the application and interpretation\nof Article 8 of ECHR and Article 7 of the Charter, have kept a balanced approached\nbetween individual interests and societal interests. The two-step test in examining an\nindividual claim related to a Convention right has strictly been followed by ECtHR.\n(vi) Decisions of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights\nArticle 11 of the American Convention on Human Rights deals with the Right to\nPrivacy. The provision is extracted below:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to have his honor respected and his dignity\nrecognized.\n298 Application No. 47143/06\n190\nPART K\n2. No one may be the object of arbitrary or abusive interference with his\nprivate life, his family, his home, or his correspondence, or of unlawful\nattacks on his honor or reputation.\n3. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such\ninterference or attacks.\u201d\nThe decision in Artavia Murillo ET AL. (\u201cIn Vitro Fertilization\u201d) v Costa Rica299\n(2012), addressed the question of whether the State\u2019s prohibition on the practice of in\nvitro fertilisation constituted an arbitrary interference with the right to private life. The\nCourt held that:\n\u201cThe scope of the protection of the right to private life has been\ninterpreted in broad terms by the international human rights\ncourts, when indicating that this goes beyond the right to privacy.\nThe protection of private life encompasses a series of factors\nassociated with the dignity of the individual, including, for\nexample, the ability to develop his or her own personality and\naspirations, to determine his or her own identity and to define\nhis or her own personal relationships. The concept of private\nlife encompasses aspects of physical and social identity,\nincluding the right to personal autonomy, personal\ndevelopment and the right to establish and develop\nrelationships with other human beings and with the outside\nworld. The effective exercise of the right to private life is\ndecisive for the possibility of exercising personal autonomy on\nthe future course of relevant events for a person\u2019s quality of\nlife. Private life includes the way in which individual views\nhimself and how he decides to project this view towards\nothers, and is an essential condition for the free development\nof the personality\u2026 Furthermore, the Court has indicated that\nmotherhood is an essential part of the free development of a\nwoman\u2019s personality. Based on the foregoing, the Court considers\nthat the decision of whether or not to become a parent is part of the\nright to private life and includes, in this case, the decision of whether\nor not to become a mother or father in the genetic or biological\nsense.\u201d (emphasis supplied)\n299 Inter-Am. Ct. H.R. (Ser. C) No. 257\n191\nPART K\nIn Escher et al v Brazil300 (2009), telephonic interception and monitoring of telephonic\nlines was carried out by the military police of the State between April and June 1999.\nThe Court found that the State violated the American Convention on Human Rights\nand held that:\n\u201cArticle 11 applies to telephone conversations irrespective of their\ncontent and can even include both the technical operations\ndesigned to record this content by taping it and listening to it, or any\nother element of the communication process; for example, the\ndestination or origin of the calls that are made, the identity of the\nspeakers, the frequency, time and duration of the calls, aspects that\ncan be verified without the need to record the content of the call by\ntaping the conversation\u2026\nArticle 11 of the Convention recognizes that every person has the\nright to respect for his honor, prohibits an illegal attack against honor\nand reputation, and imposes on the States the obligation to provide\nlegal protection against such attacks. In general, the right to honor\nrelates to self-esteem and self-worth, while reputation refers to the\nopinion that others have of a person\u2026\n[O]wing to the inherent danger of abuse in any monitoring system,\nthis measure must be based on especially precise legislation with\nclear, detailed rules. The American Convention protects the\nconfidentiality and inviolability of communications from any kind of\narbitrary or abusive interference from the State or individuals;\nconsequently, the surveillance, intervention, recording and\ndissemination of such communications is prohibited, except in the\ncases established by law that are adapted to the objects and\npurposes of the American Convention.\u201d\nLike other international jurisdictions, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights dealt\nwith the concept of privacy and private life in broad terms which enhance the value\nof liberty and freedom.\n300 Inter-Am. Ct. H.R. (Ser. C) No. 200\n192\nPART L\nThe development of the law on privacy in these jurisdictions has drawn sustenance from\nthe importance and sanctity attributed to individual freedom and liberty. Constitutions\nwhich, like the Indian Constitution, contain entrenched rights place the dignity of the\nindividual on a high pedestal. Despite cultural differences and disparate histories, a\nstudy of comparative law provides reassurance that the path which we have charted\naccords with a uniform respect for human values in the constitutional culture of the\njurisdictions which we have analysed. These values are universal and of enduring\ncharacter.\nL Criticisms of the privacy doctrine\n135 The Attorney General for India, leading the arguments before this Court on\nbehalf of Union of India, has been critical of the recognition being given to a general\nright of privacy. The submission has several facets, among them being:\n(i) there is no general or fundamental right to privacy under the Constitution;\n(ii) no blanket right to privacy can be read as part of the fundamental rights and\nwhere some of the constituent facets of privacy are already covered by the\nenumerated guarantees in Part III, those facets will be protected in any case;\n(iii) where specific species of privacy are governed by the protection of liberty in\nPart III of the Constitution, they are subject to reasonable restrictions in the\npublic interest as recognized in several decisions of this Court ;\n193\nPART L\n(iv) privacy is a concept which does not have any specific meaning or definition\nand the expression is inchoate; and\n(v) the draftsmen of the Constitution specifically did not include such a right as\npart of the chapter on fundamental rights and even the ambit of the expression\nliberty which was originally sought to be used in the draft Constitution was\npruned to personal liberty. These submissions have been buttressed by Mr\nAryama Sundaram, learned senior counsel.\n136 Criticism and critique lie at the core of democratic governance. Tolerance of\ndissent is equally a cherished value. In deciding a case of such significant dimensions,\nthe Court must factor in the criticisms voiced both domestically and internationally.\nThese, as we notice, are based on academic, philosophical and practical\nconsiderations.\n137 The Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy adverts to \u201cseveral sceptical and\ncritical accounts of privacy\u201d. The criticism is set out thus:\n\u201cThere are several sceptical and critical accounts of privacy.\nAccording to one well known argument there is no right to privacy\nand there is nothing special about privacy, because any interest\nprotected as private can be equally well explained and protected by\nother interests or rights, most notably rights to property and bodily\nsecurity (Thomson, 1975). Other critiques argue that privacy\ninterests are not distinctive because the personal interests they\nprotect are economically inefficient (Posner, 1981) or that they are\nnot grounded in any adequate legal doctrine (Bork, 1990). Finally,\nthere is the feminist critique of privacy, that granting special status\n194\nPART L\nto privacy is detrimental to women and others because it is used as\na shield to dominate and control them, silence them, and cover up\nabuse (MacKinnon, 1989).\u201d301\n138 In a 2013 article published in the Harvard Law Review, a professor of law at\nGeorgetown Law Center, Georgetown University, described privacy as having an\n\u201cimage problem\u201d302. Privacy, as she notes, has been cast as \u201cold-fashioned at best\nand downright harmful at worst - anti-progressive, overly costly, and inimical to the\nwelfare of the body politic\u201d303. The consequences in her view are predictable:\n\u201c\u2026when privacy and its purportedly outdated values must be\nbalanced against the cutting-edge imperatives of national security,\nefficiency, and entrepreneurship, privacy comes up the loser. The\nlist of privacy counterweights is long and growing. The recent\nadditions of social media, mobile platforms, cloud computing, data\nmining, and predictive analytics now threaten to tip the scales\nentirely, placing privacy in permanent opposition to the progress of\nknowledge.\u201d304\nThe article proceeds to explain that the perception of privacy as antiquated and\nsocially retrograde is wrong. Nonetheless, this criticism has relevance to India. The\nnation aspires to move to a knowledge based economy. Information is the basis of\nknowledge. The scales must, according to this critique, tip in favour of the paramount\nnational need for knowledge, innovation and development. These concerns cannot\nbe discarded and must be factored in. They are based on the need to provide\neconomic growth and social welfare to large swathes of an impoverished society.\n301 \u201cPrivacy\u201d , Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (2002) , available at\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/\n302 Julie E Cohen, \u201cWhat Privacy Is For\u201d, Harvard Law Review (2013), Vol. 126, at page 1904\n303 Ibid\n304 Ibid, at pages 1904-1905.\n195\nPART L\n139 Another criticism, which is by Robert Bork, questions the choice of\nfundamental values of the Constitution by judges of the US Supreme Court and the\ntheory (propounded by Justice Douglas in Griswold) of the existence of \u2018penumbras\u2019\nor zones of privacy created by the Bill of Rights as a leap of judicial interpretation.305\n140 The Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy seeks to offer an understanding\nof the literature on privacy in terms of two concepts: reductionism and coherentism.306\nReductionists are generally critical of privacy while the Coherentists defend\nfundamental values of privacy interests. The criticisms of privacy have been broadly\nsummarised as consisting of the following :\na Thomson\u2019s Reductionism307\nJudith Jarvis Thomson, in an article published in 1975, noted that while there is little\nagreement on the content of privacy, ultimately privacy is a cluster of rights which\noverlap with property rights or the right to bodily security. In her view, the right to\nprivacy is derivative in the sense that a privacy violation is better understood as\nviolation of a more basic right.\n305 For this criticism, see : Robert H Bork, \u201cNeutral Principles and some First Amendment Problems\u201d, Indiana\nLaw Journal (Fall 1971), Vol. 47(1), at pages 8-9\n306 Supra note 301\n307 Judith Jarvis Thomson, \u201cThe Right to Privacy\u201d , Philosophy and Public Affairs (1975), Vol. 4, at pages 295-\n314, as cited in Supra note 301\n196\nPART L\nb Posner\u2019s Economic critique308\nRichard Posner, in \u2018the Economics of Justice\u2019 published in 1981, argued that\nprivacy is protected in ways that are economically inefficient. In his view, privacy\nshould be protected only when access to information would reduce its value such as\nwhen a student is allowed access to a letter of recommendation for admission,\nrendering such a letter less reliable. According to Posner, privacy when manifested\nas control over information about oneself, is utilised to mislead or manipulate others.\nc Bork\u2019s critique\nRobert Bork, in \u2018The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law\u2019309,\nhas been severe in his criticism of the protection of privacy by the US Supreme Court.\nIn his view, Justice Douglas in Griswold did not derive privacy from some pre-existing\nright but sought to create a new right which has no foundation in the Bill of Rights,\nthereby overstepping the bounds of a judge by making new law and not by interpreting\nit.\nMany theorists urge that the constitutional right to privacy is more correctly regarded\nas a right to liberty.\nThe powerful counter argument to these criticisms is that while individuals possess\nmultiple liberties under the Constitution, read in isolation, many of them are not related\nto the kinds of concerns that emerge in privacy issues. In this view, liberty is a concept\n308 Richard Posner, The Economics of Justice, Harvard University Press (1981), as cited in Supra note 301\n309 Robert Bork, The Tempting of America : The Political Seduction of the Law, Simon and Schuster (1990), as\ncited in Supra note 301\n197\nPART L\nwhich is broader than privacy and issues or claims relating to privacy are a sub-set of\nclaims to liberty.310 Hence it has been argued that privacy protects liberty and that\n\u201cprivacy protection gains for us the freedom to define ourselves and our relations to\nothers\u201d311. This rationale understands the relationship between liberty and privacy by\nstipulating that while liberty is a broader notion, privacy is essential for protecting\nliberty. Recognizing a constitutional right to privacy is a reaffirmation of the individual\ninterest in making certain decisions crucial to one\u2019s personality and being.\nd Feminist critique\nMany writers on feminism express concern over the use of privacy as a veneer for\npatriarchal domination and abuse of women. Patriarchal notions still prevail in several\nsocieties including our own and are used as a shield to violate core constitutional\nrights of women based on gender and autonomy. As a result, gender violence is often\ntreated as a matter of \u201cfamily honour\u201d resulting in the victim of violence suffering twice\nover \u2013 the physical and mental trauma of her dignity being violated and the perception\nthat it has cause an affront to \u201chonour\u201d. Privacy must not be utilised as a cover to\nconceal and assert patriarchal mindsets.\nCatherine MacKinnon in a 1989 publication titled \u2018Towards a Feminist Theory of\nthe State\u2019312 adverts to the dangers of privacy when it is used to cover up physical\nharm done to women by perpetrating their subjection. Yet, it must also be noticed\n310 Supra note 301\n311 Ibid\n312 Catherine MacKinnon, Toward a Feminist Theory of the State, Harvard University Press (1989), as cited in\nSupra note 301\n198\nPART L\nthat women have an inviolable interest in privacy. Privacy is the ultimate guarantee\nagainst violations caused by programmes not unknown to history, such as state\nimposed sterilization programmes or mandatory state imposed drug testing for\nwomen. The challenge in this area is to enable the state to take the violation of the\ndignity of women in the domestic sphere seriously while at the same time protecting\nthe privacy entitlements of women grounded in the identity of gender and liberty.\n141 The submission that privacy has no accepted or defined connotation can be\nanalysed with reference to the evolution of the concept in the literature on the subject.\nSome of the leading approaches which should be considered for an insight into the\nambit and content of privacy:\n(i) Alan Westin313 defined four basic states of privacy which reflect on the nature\nand extent of the involvement of the individual in the public sphere. At the core is\nsolitude \u2013 the most complete state of privacy involving the individual in an \u201cinner\ndialogue with the mind and conscience\u201d.314 The second state is the state of intimacy\nwhich refers not merely to intimate relations between spouses or partners but also\nbetween family, friends and colleagues. The third state is of anonymity where an\nindividual seeks freedom from identification despite being in a public space. The\nfourth state is described as a state of reservation which is expressed as \u201cthe need to\n313 Westin\u2019s categorization of privacy is based on the specific values which it sub-serves. Westin has drawn\nsupport from the distinction made in 1960 by William L. Prosser for the purposes of civil privacy violations or\ntorts, Westin adopted a value based approach, unlike the harms based approach of Prosser. For Prosser\u2019s\nwork, see William L. Prosser, \u201cPrivacy\u201d, California Law Review (1960), Vol. 48(3), pages 383-423.\n314 Bert-Jaap Koops et al., \u201cA Typology of Privacy\u201d, University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law (2017),\nVol. 38, Issue 2, at page 496\n199\nPART L\nhold some aspects of ourselves back from others, either as too personal and sacred\nor as too shameful and profane to express\u201d315.\n(ii) Roger Clarke has developed a classification of privacy on Maslow\u2019s pyramid\nof values316. The values described in Maslow\u2019s pyramid are: self-actualization, self-\nesteem, love or belonging, safety and physiological or biological need. Clarke\u2019s\ncategories include (a) privacy of the person also known as bodily privacy. Bodily\nprivacy is violated by compulsory extraction of samples of body fluids and body tissue\nand compulsory sterilization; (b) privacy of personal behaviour which is part of a\nprivate space including the home; (c) Privacy of personal communications which is\nexpressed as the freedom of communication without interception or routine monitoring\nof one\u2019s communication by others; (d) Privacy of personal data which is linked to the\nconcept of informational privacy.\n(iii) Anita Allen has, in a 2011 publication, developed the concept of \u201cunpopular\nprivacy\u201d317. According to her, governments must design \u201cunpopular\u201d privacy laws and\nduties to protect the common good, even if privacy is being forced on individuals who\nmay not want it. Individuals under this approach are not permitted to waive their\nprivacy rights. Among the component elements which she notices are : (a) physical\nor spatial privacy \u2013 illustrated by the privacy in the home; (b) informational privacy\nincluding information data or facts about persons or their communications; (c)\n315 Ibid, at page 497\n316 Ibid, at 498\n317 Ibid, at 500\n200\nPART L\ndecisional privacy which protects the right of citizens to make intimate choices about\ntheir rights from intrusion by the State; (d) proprietary privacy which relates to the\nprotection of one\u2019s reputation; (e) associational privacy which protects the right of\ngroups with certain defined characteristics to determine whom they may include or\nexclude.318\nPrivacy has distinct connotations including (i) spatial control; (ii) decisional autonomy;\nand (iii) informational control.319 Spatial control denotes the creation of private spaces.\nDecisional autonomy comprehends intimate personal choices such as those\ngoverning reproduction as well as choices expressed in public such as faith or modes\nof dress. Informational control empowers the individual to use privacy as a shield to\nretain personal control over information pertaining to the person. With regard to\ninformational privacy, it has been stated that :\n\u201c\u2026perhaps the most convincing conception is proposed by Helen\nNissenbaum who argues that privacy is the expectation that\ninformation about a person will be treated appropriately. This\ntheory of \u201ccontextual integrity\u201d believes people do not want to\ncontrol their information or become inaccessible as much as they\nwant their information to be treated in accordance with their\nexpectation (Nissenbaum 2004, 2010, 2011).\u201d320\nIntegrated together, the fundamental notions of privacy have been depicted in a\nseminal article published in 2017 titled \u201cA Typology of privacy\u201d321 in the University\n318 Ibid, at pages 500-501\n319 Bhairav Acharya, \u201cThe Four Parts of Privacy in India\u201d, Economic & Political Weekly (2015), Vol. 50 Issue 22,\nat page 32\n320 Ibid, at page 34\n321 Bert-Jaap Koops et al., \u201cA Typology of Privacy\u201d, University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law (2017),\nVol. 38 Issue 2, at page 566\n201\nPART L\nof Pennsylvania Journal of International Law.

The nine primary types of privacy are, according to the above\ndepiction: (i) bodily privacy which reflects the privacy of the physical body. Implicit in\nthis is the negative freedom of being able to prevent others from violating one\u2019s body\nor from restraining the freedom of bodily movement; (ii) spatial privacy which is\nreflected in the privacy of a private space through which access of others can be\nrestricted to the space; intimate relations and family life are an apt illustration of spatial\nprivacy; (iii) communicational privacy which is reflected in enabling an individual to\n202\nPART M\nrestrict access to communications or control the use of information which is\ncommunicated to third parties; (iv) proprietary privacy which is reflected by the interest\nof a person in utilising property as a means to shield facts, things or information from\nothers; (v) intellectual privacy which is reflected as an individual interest in the privacy\nof thought and mind and the development of opinions and beliefs; (vi) decisional\nprivacy reflected by an ability to make intimate decisions primarily consisting one\u2019s\nsexual or procreative nature and decisions in respect of intimate relations; (vii)\nassociational privacy which is reflected in the ability of the individual to choose who\nshe wishes to interact with; (viii) behavioural privacy which recognises the privacy\ninterests of a person even while conducting publicly visible activities. Behavioural\nprivacy postulates that even when access is granted to others, the individual is entitled\nto control the extent of access and preserve to herself a measure of freedom from\nunwanted intrusion; and (ix) informational privacy which reflects an interest in\npreventing information about the self from being disseminated and controlling the\nextent of access to information.\nM Constituent Assembly and privacy: limits of originalist interpretation\n143 The founding fathers of the Constitution, it has been urged, rejected the notion\nof privacy being a fundamental right. Hence it has been submitted that it would be\noutside the realm of constitutional adjudication for the Court to declare a fundamental\nright to privacy. The argument merits close consideration.\n203\nPART M\n144 On 17 March 1947, K M Munshi submitted Draft articles on the fundamental\nrights and duties of citizens to the Sub-committee on fundamental rights.

Provision may be made by law to regulate\nthe interception or detention of articles and messages in\ncourse of transmission by post, telegraph or otherwise on\nthe occurrence of any public emergency or in the interests\nof public safety or tranquillity\u2026\n322 B. Shiva Rao, The Framing of India\u2019s Constitution, Indian Institute of Public Administration (1967), Vol. 2, at\npage 75\n323 Ibid, at page 87\n324 Ibid, at page 139\n204\nPART M\n10. The right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches\nand seizures, shall not be violated and no warrants shall\nissue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or\naffirmation, and particularly describing the place to be\nsearched, and the persons or things to be seized\u201d\n147 Dr B N Rau in his notes on the draft report had reservations about clause 10\nwhich were expressed thus325:\n\u201cClause 10. If this means that there is to be no search without a\ncourt\u2019s warrant, it may seriously affect the powers of investigation\nof the police. Under the existing law, eg., Criminal Procedure Code,\nsection 165 (relevant extracts given below), the police have certain\nimportant powers. Often in the course of investigation, a police\nofficer gets information that stolen property has been secreted in a\ncertain place. If he searches it at once, as he can at present, there\nis a chance of his recovering it; but he has to apply for a court\u2019s\nwarrant, giving full details, the delay involved, under Indian\nconditions of distance and lack of transport in the interior may be\nfatal.\u201d\nA note was submitted by Sir Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer on 10 April 1947 objecting to\nthe \u2018secrecy of correspondence\u2019 mentioned in clause 9(d) and the protection against\nunreasonable searches in clause 10326 :\n\u201cClause (d). In regard to secrecy of correspondence I raised a point\nduring the discussions that it need not find a place in chapter on\nfundamental rights and it had better be left to the protection afforded\nby the ordinary law of the land contained in the various enactments.\nThere is no such right in the American Constitution. Such a\nprovision finds a place only in the post-First World War\nconstitutions. The effect of the clauses upon the sections of the\nIndian Evidence Act bearing upon privilege will have to be\nconsidered. Restrictions -vide chapter 9, s 120-127. The result of\n325 Ibid, at page 152\n326 Ibid, at pages 158-159\n205\nPART M\nthis clause will be that every private correspondence will assume\nthe rank of a State paper, or, in the language of s. 123 and 124, a\nrecord relating to the affairs of State.\nA clause like this might checkmate the prosecution in establishing\nany case of conspiracy or abetment, the plaintiff being helpless to\nprove the same by placing before the court the correspondence that\npassed between the parties which in all these cases would furnish\nthe most material evidence. The opening words of the clause\n\u201cpublic order and morality\u201d would not be of any avail in such cases.\nOn a very careful consideration of the whole subject I feel that\ninclusion of such a clause in the chapter on fundamental rights will\nlead to endless complications and difficulties in the administration\nof justice. It will be for the committee to consider whether a\nreconsideration of the clause is called for in the above\ncircumstances.\nClause 10. Unreasonable searches, In regard to this subject I\npointed out the difference between the conditions obtaining in\nAmerica at the time when the American Constitution was drafted\nand the conditions in India obtaining at present after the provisions\nof the Criminal Procedure Code in this behalf have been in force for\nnearly a century. The effect of the clause, as it is, will be to abrogate\nsome of the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and to leave\nit to the Supreme Court in particular cases to decide whether the\nsearch is reasonable or unreasonable. While I am averse to\nreagitating the matter I think it may not be too late for the committee\nto consider this particular clause.\u201d\nDuring the course of the comments and suggestions on the draft Constitution, Jaya\nPrakash Narayan suggested the inclusion of the secrecy of postal, telegraphic and\ntelephonic communications. Such an inclusion was, however, objected to on the\nfollowing grounds327 :\n\u201c\u2026It is also hardly necessary to include secrecy of postal,\ntelegraphic and telephonic communications as a fundamental right\nin the Constitution itself as that might lead to practical difficulties in\n327 B. Shiva Rao, The Framing of India\u2019s Constitution: A Study, Indian Institute of Public Administration (1968), at\npages 219-220\n206\nPART M\nthe administration of the posts and telegraph department. The\nrelevant laws enacted by the Legislature on the subject (the Indian\nPost Office Act, 1898 and the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885) permit\ninterception of communications sent through post, telegraph or\ntelephone only in specified circumstances, such as, on the\noccurrence of an emergency and in the interests of public safety.\u201d\nEventually, clause 9(d) and clause 10 were dropped from the chapter dealing with\nfundamental rights.\n148 This discussion would indicate that there was a debate during the course of the\ndrafting of the Constitution on the proposal to guarantee to every citizen the right to\nsecrecy of correspondence in clause 9(d) and the protection to be secure against\nunreasonable searches and seizures in their persons houses, papers and assets. The\nobjection to clause 9(d) was set out in the note of dissent of Sir Alladi Krishnaswamy\nIyer and it was his view that the guarantee of secrecy of correspondence may lead to\nevery private correspondence becoming a state paper. There was also a feeling that\nthis would affect the prosecution especially in cases of conspiracy or abetment.\nSimilarly, his objection to clause 10 was that it would abrogate some of the provisions\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure. B N Rau likewise stated that this would seriously\naffect the powers of investigation of the police. The clause protecting the secrecy of\ncorrespondence was thus dropped on the ground that it would constitute a serious\nimpediment in prosecutions while the protection against unreasonable searches and\nseizures was deleted on the ground that there were provisions in the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, 1898 covering the area. The debates of the Constituent Assembly indicate\n207\nPART M\nthat the proposed inclusion (which was eventually dropped) was in two specific areas\nnamely correspondence and searches and seizures. From this, it cannot be concluded\nthat the Constituent Assembly had expressly resolved to reject the notion of the right\nto privacy as an integral element of the liberty and freedoms guaranteed by the\nfundamental rights.\n149 The Constitution has evolved over time, as judicial interpretation, led to the\nrecognition of specific interests and entitlements. These have been subsumed within\nthe freedoms and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. Article 21 has been\ninterpreted by this Court to mean that life does not mean merely a physical existence.\nIt includes all those faculties by which life is enjoyed. The ambit of \u2018the procedure\nestablished by law\u2019 has been interpreted to mean that the procedure must be fair, just\nand reasonable. The coalescence of Articles 14, 19 and 21 has brought into being a\njurisprudence which recognises the inter-relationship between rights. That is how the\nrequirements of fairness and non-discrimination animate both the substantive and\nprocedural aspects of Article 21. These constitutional developments have taken place\nas the words of the Constitution have been interpreted to deal with new exigencies\nrequiring an expansive reading of liberties and freedoms to preserve human rights\nunder the rule of law. India\u2019s brush with a regime of the suspension of life and personal\nliberty in the not too distant past is a grim reminder of how tenuous liberty can be, if\nthe judiciary is not vigilant. The interpretation of the Constitution cannot be frozen by\nits original understanding. The Constitution has evolved and must continuously evolve\n208\nPART M\nto meet the aspirations and challenges of the present and the future. Nor can judges\nforesee every challenge and contingency which may arise in the future. This is\nparticularly of relevance in an age where technology reshapes our fundamental\nunderstanding of information, knowledge and human relationships that was unknown\neven in the recent past. Hence as Judges interpreting the Constitution today, the\nCourt must leave open the path for succeeding generations to meet the challenges to\nprivacy that may be unknown today.\n150 The impact of the decision in Cooper is to establish a link between the\nfundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. The immediate\nconsequence of the decision is that a law which restricts the personal liberties\ncontained in Article 19 must meet the test of permissible restrictions contemplated by\nClauses 2 to 6 in relation to the fundamental freedom which is infringed. Moreover,\nsince the fundamental rights are inter-related, Article 21 is no longer to be construed\nas a residue of rights which are not specifically enumerated in Article 19. Both sets\nof rights overlap and hence a law which affects one of the personal freedoms under\nArticle 19 would, in addition to the requirement of meeting the permissible restrictions\ncontemplated in clauses 2 to 6, have to meet the parameters of a valid \u2018procedure\nestablished by law\u2019 under Article 21 where it impacts on life or personal liberty. The\nlaw would be assessed not with reference to its object but on the basis of its effect\nand impact on the fundamental rights. Coupled with the breakdown of the theory that\nthe fundamental rights are water-tight compartments, the post Maneka jurisprudence\ninfused the test of fairness and reasonableness in determining whether the \u2018procedure\n209\nPART M\nestablished by law\u2019 passes muster under Article 21. At a substantive level, the\nconstitutional values underlying each article in the Chapter on fundamental rights\nanimate the meaning of the others. This development of the law has followed a natural\nevolution. The basis of this development after all is that every aspect of the diverse\nguarantees of fundamental rights deals with human beings. Every element together\nwith others contributes in the composition of the human personality. In the very nature\nof things, no element can be read in a manner disjunctive from the composite whole.\nThe close relationship between each of the fundamental rights has led to the\nrecognition of constitutional entitlements and interests. Some of them may straddle\nmore than one, and on occasion several, fundamental rights. Yet others may reflect\nthe core value upon which the fundamental rights are founded. Even at the birth of\nthe Constitution, the founding fathers recognised in the Constituent Assembly that, for\ninstance, the freedom of speech and expression would comprehend the freedom of\nthe press. Hence the guarantee of free speech and expression has been interpreted\nto extend to the freedom of the press. Recognition of the freedom of the press does\nnot create by judicial fiat, a new fundamental right but is an acknowledgment of that,\nwhich lies embedded and without which the guarantee of free speech and expression\nwould not be complete. Similarly, Article 21 has been interpreted to include a\nspectrum of entitlements such as a right to a clean environment, the right to public\nhealth, the right to know, the right to means of communication and the right to\neducation, besides a panoply of rights in the context of criminal law and procedure in\nmatters such as handcuffing and speedy trial. The rights which have been held to flow\nout of Article 21 include the following:\n210\nPART M\n(i) The right to go abroad \u2013 Satwant Singh Sawhney v D Ramarathnam APO\nNew Delhi 328.\n(ii) The right against solitary confinement \u2013 Sunil Batra v Delhi Administration329.\n(iii) The right of prisoners against bar fetters \u2013 Charles Sobraj v Supdt. Central\nJail330.\n(iv) The right to legal aid \u2013 M H Hoskot v State of Maharashtra331.\n(v) The right to speedy trial \u2013 Hussainara Khatoon v Home Secretary, State of\nBihar332.\n(vi) The right against handcuffing \u2013 Prem Shankar Shukla v Delhi\nAdministration333.\n(vii) The right against custodial violence \u2013 Sheela Barse v State of Maharashtra334.\n(viii) The right against public hanging \u2013 A G of India v Lachma Devi335.\n(ix) Right to doctor\u2019s assistance at government hospitals \u2013 Paramanand Katara v\nUnion of India336.\n(x) Right to shelter \u2013 Shantistar Builders v N K Totame337.\n(xi) Right to a healthy environment \u2013 Virender Gaur v State of Haryana338.\n(xii) Right to compensation for unlawful arrest \u2013 Rudal Sah v State of Bihar339.\n328 (1967) 3 SCR 525\n329 (1978) 4 SCC 494\n330 (1978) 4 SCC 104\n331 (1978) 3 SCC 544\n332 (1980) 1 SCC 81\n333 (1980) 3 SCC 526\n334 (1983) 2 SCC 96\n335 (1989) Suppl.(1) SCC 264\n336 (1989) 4 SCC 286\n337 (1990) 1 SCC 520\n338 (1995) 2 SCC 577\n339 (1983) 4 SCC 141\n211\nPART M\n(xiii) Right to freedom from torture \u2013 Sunil Batra v Delhi Administration340.\n(xiv) Right to reputation \u2013 Umesh Kumar v State of Andhra Pradesh341.\n(xv) Right to earn a livelihood \u2013 Olga Tellis v Bombay Municipal Corporation342.\nNeither is this an exercise in constitutional amendment brought about by judicial\ndecision nor does it result in the creation of a new set of fundamental rights. The\nexercise has been one of interpreting existing rights guaranteed by the Constitution\nand while understanding the core of those rights, to define the ambit of what the right\ncomprehends.\n151 The draftsmen of the Constitution had a sense of history\uf02d both global and\ndomestic\u2013 as they attempted to translate their vision of freedom into guarantees\nagainst authoritarian behaviour. The Constitution adopted a democratic form of\ngovernment based on the rule of law. The framers were conscious of the widespread\nabuse of human rights by authoritarian regimes in the two World Wars separated over\na period of two decades. The framers were equally conscious of the injustice suffered\nunder a colonial regime and more recently of the horrors of partition. The backdrop\nof human suffering furnished a reason to preserve a regime of governance based on\nthe rule of law which would be subject to democratic accountability against a violation\nof fundamental freedoms. The content of the fundamental rights evolved over the\n340(1978) 4 SCC 494\n341 (2013) 10 SCC 591\n342 (1985) 3 SCC 545\n212\nPART M\ncourse of our constitutional history and any discussion of the issues of privacy,\ntogether with its relationship with liberty and dignity, would be incomplete without a\nbrief reference to the course of history as it unravels in precedent. By guaranteeing\nthe freedoms and liberties embodied in the fundamental rights, the Constitution has\npreserved natural rights and ring-fenced them from attempts to attenuate their\nexistence.\nTechnology, as we experience it today is far different from what it was in the lives of\nthe generation which drafted the Constitution. Information technology together with\nthe internet and the social media and all their attendant applications have rapidly\naltered the course of life in the last decade. Today\u2019s technology renders models of\napplication of a few years ago obsolescent. Hence, it would be an injustice both to the\ndraftsmen of the Constitution as well as to the document which they sanctified to\nconstrict its interpretation to an originalist interpretation. Today\u2019s problems have to be\nadjudged by a vibrant application of constitutional doctrine and cannot be frozen by a\nvision suited to a radically different society. We describe the Constitution as a living\ninstrument simply for the reason that while it is a document which enunciates eternal\nvalues for Indian society, it possesses the resilience necessary to ensure its continued\nrelevance. Its continued relevance lies precisely in its ability to allow succeeding\ngenerations to apply the principles on which it has been founded to find innovative\nsolutions to intractable problems of their times. In doing so, we must equally\nunderstand that our solutions must continuously undergo a process of re-engineering.\n213\nPART N\nN Is the statutory protection to privacy reason to deny a constitutional right?\n152 The Union government and some of the States which have supported it have\nurged this Court that there is a statutory regime by virtue of which the right to privacy\nis adequately protected and hence it is not necessary to read a constitutional right to\nprivacy into the fundamental rights. This submission is sought to be fortified by\ncontending that privacy is merely a common law right and the statutory protection is\na reflection of that position.\n153 The submission betrays lack of understanding of the reason why rights are\nprotected in the first place as entrenched guarantees in a Bill of Rights or, as in the\ncase of the Indian Constitution, as part of the fundamental rights. Elevating a right to\nthe position of a constitutionally protected right places it beyond the pale of legislative\nmajorities. When a constitutional right such as the right to equality or the right to life\nassumes the character of being a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, it\nassumes inviolable status: inviolability even in the face of the power of amendment.\nOrdinary legislation is not beyond the pale of legislative modification. A statutory right\ncan be modified, curtailed or annulled by a simple enactment of the legislature. In\nother words, statutory rights are subject to the compulsion of legislative majorities.\nThe purpose of infusing a right with a constitutional element is precisely to provide it\na sense of immunity from popular opinion and, as its reflection, from legislative\nannulment. Constitutionally protected rights embody the liberal belief that personal\nliberties of the individual are so sacrosanct that it is necessary to ensconce them in a\n214\nPART O\nprotective shell that places them beyond the pale of ordinary legislation. To negate a\nconstitutional right on the ground that there is an available statutory protection is to\ninvert constitutional theory. As a matter of fact, legislative protection is in many cases,\nan acknowledgment and recognition of a constitutional right which needs to be\neffectuated and enforced through protective laws.\nFor instance, the provisions of Section 8(1)(j) of the Right to Information Act, 2005\nwhich contain an exemption from the disclosure of information refer to such\ninformation which would cause an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the\nindividual.\nBut the important point to note is that when a right is conferred with an entrenched\nconstitutional status in Part III, it provides a touchstone on which the validity of\nexecutive decision making can be assessed and the validity of law can be determined\nby judicial review. Entrenched constitutional rights provide the basis of evaluating the\nvalidity of law. Hence, it would be plainly unacceptable to urge that the existence of\nlaw negates the rationale for a constitutional right or renders the constitutional right\nunnecessary.\nO Not an elitist construct\n154 The Attorney General argued before us that the right to privacy must be\nforsaken in the interest of welfare entitlements provided by the State. In our view, the\nsubmission that the right to privacy is an elitist construct which stands apart from the\n215\nPART O\nneeds and aspirations of the large majority constituting the rest of society, is\nunsustainable. This submission betrays a misunderstanding of the constitutional\nposition. Our Constitution places the individual at the forefront of its focus,\nguaranteeing civil and political rights in Part III and embodying an aspiration for\nachieving socio- economic rights in Part IV. The refrain that the poor need no civil\nand political rights and are concerned only with economic well-being has been utilised\nthough history to wreak the most egregious violations of human rights. Above all, it\nmust be realised that it is the right to question, the right to scrutinize and the right to\ndissent which enables an informed citizenry to scrutinize the actions of government.\nThose who are governed are entitled to question those who govern, about the\ndischarge of their constitutional duties including in the provision of socio-economic\nwelfare benefits. The power to scrutinize and to reason enables the citizens of a\ndemocratic polity to make informed decisions on basic issues which govern their\nrights. The theory that civil and political rights are subservient to socio-economic rights\nhas been urged in the past and has been categorically rejected in the course of\nconstitutional adjudication by this Court.\n155 Civil and political rights and socio-economic rights do not exist in a state of\nantagonism. The conditions necessary for realising or fulfilling socio-economic rights\ndo not postulate the subversion of political freedom. The reason for this is simple.\nSocio-economic entitlements must yield true benefits to those for whom they are\nintended. This can be achieved by eliminating rent-seeking behaviour and by\n216\nPART O\npreventing the capture of social welfare benefits by persons who are not entitled to\nthem. Capture of social welfare benefits can be obviated only when political systems\nare transparent and when there is a free flow of information. Opacity enures to the\nbenefit of those who monopolize scarce economic resources. On the other hand,\nconditions where civil and political freedoms flourish ensure that governmental\npolicies are subjected to critique and assessment. It is this scrutiny which sub-serves\nthe purpose of ensuring that socio-economic benefits actually permeate to the under-\nprivileged for whom they are meant. Conditions of freedom and a vibrant assertion of\ncivil and political rights promote a constant review of the justness of socio-economic\nprogrammes and of their effectiveness in addressing deprivation and want. Scrutiny\nof public affairs is founded upon the existence of freedom. Hence civil and political\nrights and socio-economic rights are complementary and not mutually exclusive.\n156 Some of these themes have been addressed in the writings of the Nobel\nlaureate, Amartya Sen. Sen compares the response of many non-democratic regimes\nin critical situations such as famine with the responses of democratic societies in\nsimilar situations.343 His analysis reveals that the political immunity enjoyed by\ngovernment leaders in authoritarian states prevents effective measures being taken\nto address such conditions:\n\u201cFor example, Botswana had a fall in food production of 17 percent\nand Zimbabwe one of 38 percent between 1979-1981 and 1983-\n1984, in the same period in which the food production decline\n343 Amartya Sen, Development as Freedom, Oxford University Press (2000), at page 178-179\n217\nPART O\namounted to a relatively modest 11 or 12 percent in Sudan and\nEthiopia. But while Sudan and Ethiopia, with comparatively smaller\ndeclines in food output, had massive famines, Botswana and\nZimbabwe had none, and this was largely due to timely and\nextensive famine prevention policies by these latter countries.\nHad the governments in Botswana and Zimbabwe failed to\nundertake timely action, they would have been under severe\ncriticism and pressure from the opposition and would have gotten\nplenty of flak from newspapers. In contrast, the Ethiopian and\nSudanese governments did not have to reckon with those\nprospects, and the political incentives provided by democratic\ninstitutions were thoroughly absent in those countries. Famines in\nSudan and Ethiopia \u2013 and in many other countries in sub-Saharan\nAfrica \u2013 were fed by the political immunity enjoyed by governmental\nleaders in authoritarian countries. This would seem to apply to the\npresent situation in North Korea as well.\u201d344\nIn the Indian context, Sen points out that the Bengal famine of 1943 \u201cwas made viable\nnot only by the lack of democracy in colonial India but also by severe restrictions on\nreporting and criticism imposed on the Indian press, and the voluntary practice of\n\u2018silence\u2019 on the famine that the British-owned media chose to follow\u201d345. Political\nliberties and democratic rights are hence regarded as \u2018constituent components\u2019 of\ndevelopment.346 In contrast during the drought which took place in Maharashtra in\n1973, food production failed drastically and the per capita food output was half of that\nin sub-Saharan Africa. Yet there was no famine in Maharashtra where five million\npeople were employed in rapidly organized public projects while there were\n344 Ibid, at page 179\n345 Amartya Sen, The Idea of Justice, Penguin Books (2009), at page 339\n346 Ibid, at page 347\n218\nPART O\nsubstantial famines in sub-Saharan Africa. This establishes what he terms as \u201cthe\nprotective role of democracy\u201d. Sen has analysed the issue succinctly:\n\u201cThe causal connection between democracy and the non-\noccurrence of famines is not hard to seek. Famines kill millions of\npeople in different countries in the world, but they don\u2019t kill the\nrulers. The kings and the presidents, the bureaucrats and the\nbosses, the military leaders and the commanders never are famine\nvictims. And if there are no elections, no opposition parties, no\nscope for uncensored public criticism, then those in authority don\u2019t\nhave to suffer the political consequences of their failure to prevent\nfamines. Democracy, on the other hand, would spread the penalty\nof famines to the ruling groups and political leaders as well. This\ngives them the political incentive to try to prevent any threatening\nfamine, and since famines are in fact easy to prevent (the economic\nargument clicks into the political one at this stage), the approaching\nfamines are firmly prevented.\u201d347\nThere is, in other words, an intrinsic relationship between development and freedom:\n\u201c\u2026development cannot really be seen merely as the process of\nincreasing inanimate objects of convenience, such as raising the\nGNP per head, or promoting industrialization or technological\nadvance or social modernization. These accomplishments are, of\ncourse, valuable \u2013 often crucially important \u2013 but their value must\ndepend on what they do to the lives and freedoms of the people\ninvolved. For adult human beings, with responsibility for choice, the\nfocus must ultimately be on whether they have the freedom to do\nwhat they have reason to value. In this sense, development consists\nof expansion of people\u2019s freedom.\u201d348\n347 Amartya Sen, Development as Freedom, Oxford University Press (2000), at page 180\n348 Amartya Sen, \u201cThe Country of First Boys\u201d, Oxford University Press, Pg.80-81\n219\nPART O\nIn an article recently published in July 2017 in Public Law, titled \u201cThe Untapped\nPotential of the Mandela Constitution\u201d349, Justice Edwin Cameron, a distinguished\njudge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa, has provided a telling example.\nPresident Mbeki of South Africa doubted the medical science underlying AIDS and\neffectively obstructed a feasible ARV programme. This posture of AIDS denialism\nplunged South Africa into a crisis of public health as a result of which the drug\nNevirapine which was offered to the South African government free of charge was\nrefused. Eventually it was when the South African Constitutional Court intervened in\nthe Treatment Action Campaign decision350 that it was held that the government\nhad failed the reasonableness test. The article notes that as a result of the decision,\nthe drug became available and \u201chundreds and thousands, perhaps millions, of lives\nhave been saved\u201d. Besides, the article notes that the judgment changed the public\ndiscourse of AIDS and \u201ccut-through the obfuscation of denials and in doing so, dealt\nit a fatal blow\u201d351.\nExamples can be multiplied on how a state sanctioned curtain of misinformation or\nstate mandated black-outs of information can cause a serious denial of socio-\neconomic rights. The strength of Indian democracy lies in the foundation provided by\n349 Edwin Cameron and Max Taylor, \u201cThe Untapped Potential of the Mandela Constitution\u201d, Public Law (2017),\nat page 394\n350 Minister of Health v Treatment Action Campaign, (2002) 5 SA 721 (CC)\n351 Edwin Cameron and Max Taylor, \u201cThe Untapped Potential of the Mandela Constitution\u201d, Public Law (2017),\nat page 395\n220\nPART P\nthe Constitution to liberty and freedom. Liberty and freedom are values which are\nintrinsic to our constitutional order. But they also have an instrumental value in\ncreating conditions in which socio-economic rights can be achieved. India has no iron\ncurtain. Our society prospers in the shadow of its drapes which let in sunshine and\nreflect a multitude of hues based on language, religion, culture and ideologies.\n157 We need also emphasise the lack of substance in the submission that privacy\nis a privilege for the few. Every individual in society irrespective of social class or\neconomic status is entitled to the intimacy and autonomy which privacy protects. It is\nprivacy as an intrinsic and core feature of life and personal liberty which enables an\nindividual to stand up against a programme of forced sterilization. Then again, it is\nprivacy which is a powerful guarantee if the State were to introduce compulsory drug\ntrials of non-consenting men or women. The sanctity of marriage, the liberty of\nprocreation, the choice of a family life and the dignity of being are matters which\nconcern every individual irrespective of social strata or economic well being. The\npursuit of happiness is founded upon autonomy and dignity. Both are essential\nattributes of privacy which makes no distinction between the birth marks of individuals.\nP Not just a common law right\n158 There is also no merit in the defence of the Union and the States that privacy\nis merely a common law right. The fact that a right may have been afforded protection\nat common law does not constitute a bar to the constitutional recognition of the right.\n221\nPART P\nThe Constitution recognises the right simply because it is an incident of a fundamental\nfreedom or liberty which the draftsperson considered to be so significant as to require\nconstitutional protection. Once privacy is held to be an incident of the protection of\nlife, personal liberty and of the liberties guaranteed by the provisions of Part III of the\nConstitution, the submission that privacy is only a right at common law misses the\nwood for the trees. The central theme is that privacy is an intrinsic part of life, personal\nliberty and of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III which entitles it to protection as a\ncore of constitutional doctrine. The protection of privacy by the Constitution liberates\nit, as it were, from the uncertainties of statutory law which, as we have noted, is subject\nto the range of legislative annulments open to a majoritarian government. Any\nabridgment must meet the requirements prescribed by Article 21, Article 19 or the\nrelevant freedom. The Constitutional right is placed at a pedestal which embodies\nboth a negative and a positive freedom. The negative freedom protects the individual\nfrom unwanted intrusion. As a positive freedom, it obliges the State to adopt suitable\nmeasures for protecting individual privacy. An apt description of this facet is contained\nin the Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Comparative Constitutional Law, in its\nsection on the right to privacy352 :\n\u201c2. The right to privacy can be both negatively and positively\ndefined. The negative right to privacy entails the individuals are\nprotected from unwanted intrusion by both the state and private\nactors into their private life, especially features that define their\npersonal identity such as sexuality, religion and political affiliation,\nie the inner core of a person\u2019s private life\u2026.\n352 Anna Jonsson Cornell, \u201cRight to Privacy\u201d, Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Comparative Constitutional Law\n(2015)\n222\nPART Q\nThe positive right to privacy entails an obligation of states to remove\nobstacles for an autonomous shaping of individual identities.\u201d\nQ Substantive Due Process\n159 During the course of the hearing, Mr Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel\nappearing on behalf of the State of Gujarat submitted that the requirement of a valid\nlaw with reference to Article 21 is not conditioned by the notion of substantive due\nprocess. Substantive due process, it was urged is a concept which has been evolved\nin relation to the US Constitution but is inapposite in relation to the Indian Constitution.\nThe history surrounding the drafting of Article 21 indicates a conscious decision by\nthe Constituent Assembly not to introduce the expression \u201cdue process of law\u201d which\nis incorporated in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution. The\ndraft Constitution which was prepared by the Drafting Committee chaired by Dr B R\nAmbedkar contained a \u2018due process\u2019 clause to the effect that \u2018nor any State shall\ndeprive any person of life, liberty and property without due process of law\u2019. The clause\nas originally drafted was subjected to three important changes in the Constituent\nAssembly. Firstly, the reference to property was deleted from the above clause of the\ndraft Constitution. The members of the Constituent Assembly perceived that retaining\nthe right to property as part of the due process clause would pose a serious\nimpediment to legislative reform particularly with the redistribution of property. The\nsecond important change arose from a meeting which Shri B N Rau had with Justice\n223\nPART Q\nFelix Frankfurter in the US. In the US particularly in the years around the Great\nDepression, American Courts had utilised the due process clause to invalidate social\nwelfare legislation. In the Lochner353 era, the US Supreme Court invalidated\nlegislation such as statutes prohibiting employers from making their employees work\nfor more than ten hours a day or sixty hours a week on the supposition that this\ninfringed the liberty of contract. Between 1899 and 1937 (excluding the civil rights\ncases), 159 US Supreme Court decisions held state statutes unconstitutional under\nthe due process and equal protection clauses. Moreover, 25 other statutes were\nstruck down under the due process clause together with other provisions of the\nAmerican Constitution.354 Under the due process clause, the US Supreme Court\nstruck down labour legislation prohibiting employers from discriminating on the\ngrounds of union activity; regulation of wages; regulation of prices for commodities\nand services; and legislation denying entry into business.355 These decisions were\neventually distinguished or overruled in 1937 and thereafter.356\n160 The Constituent Assembly, in this background, made a second important\nchange in the original draft by qualifying the expression \u2018liberty\u2019 with the word\n\u2018personal\u2019. Shri B N Rau suggested that if this qualification were not to be introduced,\n353 Lochner v New York, 198 US 45 (1905)\n354 William B Lockhart, et al, Constitutional Law: Cases- Comments-Questions, West Publishing Co.

In the United States he met\nSupreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, who told him that he\nconsidered the power of judicial review implied in the due process\nclause both undemocratic \u2013 because a few judges could veto\nlegislation enacted by the representatives of a nation \u2013 and\nburdensome to the Judiciary. Frankfurter had been strongly\ninfluenced by the Harvard Law School\u2019s great constitutional lawyer,\nJames Bradley Thayer, who also feared that too great a reliance on\ndue process as a protection against legislative oversight or\nmisbehaviour might weaken the democratic process. Thayer\u2019s\nviews had impressed Rau even before he met Frankfurter. In his\nConstitutional Precedents, Rau had pointed out that Thayer and\nothers had \u2018drawn attention to the dangers of attempting to find in\nthe Supreme Court \u2013 instead of in the lessons of experience \u2013 a\nsafeguard against the mistakes of the representatives of people\u2019.\u201d\n357 B.

In his words360 :\n\u201c\u2026In the development of the doctrine of \u2018due process\u2019 the United\nStates Supreme Court has not adopted a consistent view at all and\nthe decisions are conflicting\u2026\nThe Minimum Wage Law or a Restraint on Employment have in\nsome cases been regarded as an invasion of personal liberty and\nfreedom, by the United States Supreme Court in its earlier\ndecisions, the theory being that it is an essential part of personal\nliberty that every person in the world be she a woman, be he a child\nover fourteen years of age or be he a labourer, has the right to enter\ninto any contract he or she liked and it is not the province of other\npeople to interfere with that liberty. On that ground, in the earlier\ndecisions of Supreme Court it has been held that the Minimum\nWages Laws are invalid as invading personal liberty\u2026\nThe clause may serve as a great handicap for all social legislation,\nand for the protection of women\u2026\nI trust that the House will take into account the various aspects of\nthis question, the future progress of India, the well-being and the\nsecurity of the States, the necessity of maintaining a minimum of\nliberty, the need for co-ordinating social control and personal liberty,\nbefore coming to a decision. One thing also will have to be taken\ninto account, viz., that the security of the State is far from being so\nsecure as we are imagining at present\u2026\u201d\nOn the other hand, several members of the Constituent Assembly preferred the\nretention of the phrase \u2018due process\u2019, among them being Dr Sitaramayya, T T\nKrishnamachari, K Santhanam, M A Ayyangar, Dr B V Keskar, S L Saksena, Thakur\n359 Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol. 7 (6th December 1948), available at\nhttp://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/vol7p20b.htm\n360 Ibid\n226\nPART Q\nDas Bhargava, Hukam Singh and four members of the Muslim League.361 K M Munshi\nstated that362 :\n\u201c\u2026a substantive interpretation of due process could not apply to\nliberty of contract \u2013 the basis on which the United States Supreme\nCourt had, at the beginning of the century, declared some social\nlegislation to be an infringement of due process and hence\nunconstitutional \u2013 but only to liberty of person, because \u2018personal\u2019\nhad been added to qualify liberty. \u2018When a law has been passed\nwhich entitles the government to take away the personal liberty of\nan individual, Munshi said, \u2018the court will consider whether the law\nwhich has been passed is such as is required by the exigencies of\nthe case and therefore, as I said, the balance will be struck between\nindividual liberty and social control. Other Assembly members\nagreed: whilst not wishing to impede the passage of social reform\nlegislation they sought to protect the individual\u2019s personal liberty\nagainst prejudicial action by an arbitrary Executive.\u201d\nDr B R Ambedkar in an insightful observation, presented the merits and demerits of\nthe rival viewpoints dispassionately. In his words363 :\n\u201cThere are two views on this point. One view is this; that the\nlegislature may be trusted not to make any law which would\nabrogate the fundamental rights of man, so to say, the fundamental\nrights which apply to every individual, and consequently, there is no\ndanger arising from the introduction of the phrase \u2018due process\u2019.\nAnother view is this : that it is not possible to trust the legislature;\nthe legislature is likely to err, is likely to be led away by passion, by\nparty prejudice, by party considerations, and the legislature may\nmake a law which may abrogate what may be regarded as the\nfundamental principles which safeguard the individual rights of a\ncitizen. We are therefore placed in two difficult positions. One is to\ngive the judiciary the authority to sit in judgment over the will of the\nlegislature and to question the law made by the legislature on the\nground that it is not good law, in consonance with fundamental\nprinciples. Is that a desirable principle? The second position is that\n361 Granville Austin (Supra note 358), at page 105\n362 Ibid, at pages 105-106\n363 Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol. 7 (13th December 1948), available at\nhttp://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/vol7p25a.htm\n227\nPART Q\nthe legislature ought to be trusted not to make bad laws. It is very\ndifficult to come to any definite conclusion. There are dangers on\nboth sides. For myself I cannot altogether omit the possibility of a\nLegislature packed by party men making laws which may abrogate\nor violate what we regard as certain fundamental principles\naffecting the life and liberty of an individual. At the same time, I do\nnot see how five or six gentlemen sitting in the Federal or Supreme\nCourt examining laws made by the Legislature and by dint of their\nown individual conscience or their bias or their prejudices be trusted\nto determine which law is good and which law is bad. It is rather a\ncase where a man has to sail between Charybdis and Scylla and I\ntherefor would not say anything. I would leave it to the House to\ndecide in any way it likes.\u201d\nThe amendments proposed by some members to reintroduce \u2018due process\u2019 were\nrejected on 13 December 1948 and the phrase \u201cdue process of law\u201d was deleted from\nthe original draft Constitution. However, Article 22 was introduced into the Constitution\nto protect against arbitrary arrest and detention by incorporating several safeguards.\n162 In Gopalan, the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 was challenged on the ground\nthat it denied significant procedural safeguards against arbitrary detention. The\nmajority rejected the argument that the expression \u2018procedure established by law\u2019\nmeant procedural due process. Chief Justice Kania noted that Article 21 of our\nConstitution had consciously been drawn up by the draftsmen so as to not use the\nword \u2018due process\u2019 which was used in the American Constitution. Hence it was\nimpermissible to read the expression \u2018procedure established by law\u2019 to mean\n\u2018procedural due process\u2019 or as requiring compliance with natural justice. Justice\nPatanjali Sastri held that reading the expression \u2018due process of law\u2019 into the\nConstitution was impermissible since it would lead to those \u2018subtle and elusive criteria\u2019\n228\nPART Q\nimplied in the phrase which it was the deliberate purpose of the framers of our\nConstitution to avoid. Similarly, Justice Das also observed that our Constitution\nmakers had deliberately declined to adopt \u201cthe uncertain and shifting American\ndoctrine of due process of law\u201d which could not, therefore, be read into Article 21.\nHence, the view of the majority was that once the procedure was established by a\nvalidly enacted law, Article 21 would not be violated.\n163 In his celebrated dissent, Justice Fazl Ali pointed out that the phrase \u2018procedure\nestablished by law\u2019 was borrowed from the Japanese Constitution (which was drafted\nunder American influence at the end of the Second World War) and hence the\nexpression means \u2018procedural due process\u2019. In Justice Fazl Ali\u2019s view the deprivation\nof life and personal liberty under Article 21, had to be preceded by (i) a notice; (ii) an\nopportunity of being heard; (iii) adjudication by an impartial tribunal; and (iv) an orderly\ncourse of procedure. Formulating these four principles, Justice Fazl Ali held thus:\n\u201c\u2026Article 21 purports to protect life and personal liberty, and it\nwould be a precarious protection and a protection not worth having,\nif the elementary principle of law under discussion which, according\nto Halsbury is on a par with fundamental rights, is to be ignored and\nexcluded. In the course of his arguments, the learned counsel for\nthe petitioner repeatedly asked whether the Constitution would\npermit a law being enacted, abolishing the mode of trial permitted\nby the existing law and establishing the procedure of trial by battle\nor trial by ordeal which was in vogue in olden times in England. The\nquestion envisages something which is not likely to happen, but it\ndoes raise a legal problem which can perhaps be met only in this\nway that if the expression \u201cprocedure established by law\u201d simply\nmeans any procedure established or enacted by statute it will be\ndifficult to give a negative answer to the question, but if the word\n\u201claw\u201d includes what I have endeavoured to show it does, such an\nanswer may be justified. It seems to me that there is nothing\n229\nPART Q\nrevolutionary in the doctrine that the words \u201cprocedure established\nby law\u201d must include the four principles set out in Professor Willis\u2019\nbook, which, as I have already stated, are different aspects of the\nsame principle and which have no vagueness or uncertainty about\nthem. These principles, as the learned author points out and as the\nauthorities show, are not absolutely rigid principles but are\nadaptable to the circumstances of each case within certain limits. I\nhave only to add that it has not been seriously controverted that\n\u201claw\u201d in this article means valid law and \u201cprocedure\u201d means certain\ndefinite rules of proceeding and not something which is a mere\npretence for procedure.\u201d364\nIn Maneka, where the passport of the petitioner was impounded without furnishing\nreasons, a majority of judges found that the expression \u2018procedure established by law\u2019\ndid not mean any procedure howsoever arbitrary or fanciful. The procedure had to be\nfair, just and reasonable. The views of Justices Chandrachud, Bhagwati and Krishna\nIyer emerge from the following brief extracts:\n\u201cChandrachud, J.:\n\u2026But the mere prescription of some kind of procedure cannot ever\nmeet the mandate of Article 21. The procedure prescribed by law\nhas to be fair, just and reasonable, not fanciful, oppressive or\narbitrary.\u201d365\n\u201cBhagwati, J.:\nThe principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as\nphilosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-\narbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a brooding omnipresence and\nthe procedure contemplated by Article 21 must answer the test of\nreasonableness in order to be in conformity with Article 14. It must\nbe \u201cright and just and fair\u201d and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive;\notherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of\nArticle 21 would not be satisfied.\u201d366\n364 Gopalan (Supra note 3), at pages 60-61 (para 77)\n365 Maneka (Supra note 5), at page 323 (para 48)\n366 Ibid, at page 284 (para 7)\n230\nPART Q\n\u201cKrishna Iyer, J.:\n\u2026So I am convinced that to frustrate Article 21 by relying on any\nformal adjectival statute, however, flimsy or fantastic its provisions\nbe, is to rob what the constitution treasures.\n\u2026To sum up, \u201cprocedure\u201d in Article 21 means fair, not formal\nprocedure. \u201cLaw\u201d is reasonable law, not any enacted piece.\u201d367\nSoon after the decision in Maneka, the Supreme Court considered a challenge to the\nprovisions for solitary confinement under Section 30(2) of the Prisons Act, 1894 which\nstipulated that a prisoner \u201cunder sentence of death\u201d is to be kept in a cell apart from\nother prisoners. In Sunil Batra v Delhi Administration368, the Court pointed out that\nSections 73 and 74 of the Penal Code which contain a substantive punishment by\nway of solitary confinement was not under challenge. Section 30(2) of the Prisons\nAct was read down by holding that the expression \u201cunder sentence of death\u201d would\napply only after the entire process of remedies had been exhausted by the convict\nand the clemency petition had been denied. Justice D A Desai, speaking for the\nmajority, held that:\n\u201c\u2026the word \u201claw\u201d in the expression \u201cprocedure established by law\u201d\nin Article 21 has been interpreted to mean in Maneka Gandhi\u2019s case\nthat the law must be right, just and fair and not arbitrary, fanciful or\noppressive.\u201d369\n367 Ibid, at page 338 (paras 82 and 85)\n368 (1978) 4 SCC 494\n369 Ibid, at pages 574-575 (para 228)\n231\nPART Q\nJustice Krishna Iyer took note of the fact that our Constitution does not contain a due\nprocess clause and opined that after the decision in Maneka, the absence of such a\nclause would make no difference:\n\u201c\u2026true, our Constitution has no \u2018due process\u2019 clause or the VIIIth\nAmendment; but, in this branch of law, after Cooper and Maneka\nGandhi the consequence is the same.\u201d370\n164 A substantive challenge to the constitutional validity of the death penalty on a\nconviction on a charge of murder was raised in Bachan Singh371. The judgment\nnoted:\n\u201c136. Article 21 reads as under:\n\u201cNo person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty\nexcept according to procedure established by law.\u201d\nIf this Article is expanded in accordance with the interpretative\nprinciple indicated in Maneka Gandhi, it will read as follows:\n\u201cNo person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty\nexcept according to fair, just and reasonable procedure\nestablished by valid law.\"\nIn the converse positive form, the expanded Article will read as\nbelow:\n\u201cA person may be deprived of his life or personal liberty in\naccordance with fair, just and reasonable procedure\nestablished by valid law.\u201d\u201d372\nBachan Singh clearly involved a substantive challenge to the constitutional validity\nof a statutory provision. The majority adjudicated upon the constitutional challenge\nunder Article 21 and held that it did not suffer from substantive or procedural invalidity.\n370 Ibid, at page 518 (para 52)\n371 (1980) 2 SCC 684\n372 Ibid, at page 730 (para 136)\n232\nPART Q\nIn his dissent373, Justice Bhagwati significantly observed that the word \u201cprocedure\u201d\nunder Article 21 would cover the entire process by which deprivation is effected and\nthat would include not only \u201cthe adjectival\u201d but also substantive part of law. In the view\nof the Court:\n\u201cThe word \u2018procedure\u2019 in Article 21 is wide enough to cover the\nentire process by which deprivation is effected and that would\ninclude not only the adjectival but also the substantive part of\nlaw.\u201d374\nIn Mithu v State of Punjab375 (\u201cMithu\u201d), a Constitution Bench considered the validity\nof Section 303 of the Penal Code which provided for a mandatory death penalty where\na person commits murder while undergoing a sentence of life imprisonment. Section\n303 excluded the procedural safeguards under Section 235(2) and 354(3) of the\nCriminal Procedure Code under which the accused is required to be heard on the\nquestion of sentence and \u201cspecial reasons\u201d need to be adduced for imposing the\ndeath sentence. In the course of the judgment, Chandrachud C J indicated examples\nof situations where a substantive enactment could be challenged on the touchstone\nof Articles 14 and 21. The observations of the Court, which are extracted below would\nindicate that while the Court did not use the expression \u201csubstantive due process\u201d it\nrecognised that a law would be amenable to challenge under Article 21 not only on\nthe ground that the procedure which it prescribes is not fair, just and reasonable but\n373 (1982) 3 SCC 24\n374 Ibid, at page 55 (para 17)\n375 (1983) 2 SCC 277\n233\nPART Q\non the touchstone of having imposed a penalty which is savage or, as the Court held,\nan anathema of civilised jurisprudence :\n\u201cThese decisions have expanded the scope of Article 21 in a\nsignificant way and it is now too late in the day to contend that it is\nfor the legislature to prescribe the procedure and for the courts to\nfollow it; that it is for the legislature to provide the punishment and\nfor the courts to impose it. Two instances, undoubtedly extreme,\nmay be taken by way of illustration for the purpose of showing how\nthe courts are not bound, and are indeed not free, to apply a\nfanciful procedure by a blind adherence to the letter of the law\nor to impose a savage sentence. A law providing that an\naccused shall not be allowed to lead evidence in self-defence\nwill be hit by Articles 14 and 21. Similarly, if a law were to\nprovide that the offence of theft will be punishable with the\npenalty of the cutting of hands, the law will be bad as violating\nArticle 21. A savage sentence is anathema to the civilized\njurisprudence of Article 21. These are, of course, extreme\nillustrations and we need have no fear that our legislatures will ever\npass such laws. But these examples serve to illustrate that the\nlast word on the question of justice and fairness does not rest\nwith the legislature. Just as reasonableness of restrictions under\nclauses (2) to (6) of Article 19 is for the courts to determine, so is it\nfor the courts to decide whether the procedure prescribed by a law\nfor depriving a person of his life or liberty is fair, just and reasonable.\nThe question which then arises before us is whether the sentence\nof death, prescribed by Section 303 of the Penal Code for the\noffence of murder committed by a person who is under a sentence\nof life imprisonment, is arbitrary and oppressive so as to be violative\nof the fundamental right conferred by Article 21.\u201d376\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn A K Roy v Union of India377, dealing with the question of preventive detention, a\nConstitution Bench of this Court adverted to the conscious decision in the Constituent\n376 Ibid, at pages 284-285 (para 6)\n377 (1982) 1 SCC 271\n234\nPART Q\nAssembly to delete the expression \u2018due process of law\u2019 from Article 21. The Court held\nthat:\n\u201cThe fact that England and America do not resort to preventive\ndetention in normal times was known to our Constituent Assembly\nand yet it chose to provide for it, sanctioning its use for specified\npurposes. The attitude of two other well-known democracies to\npreventive detention as a means of regulating the lives and liberties\nof the people was undoubtedly relevant to the framing of our\nConstitution. But the framers having decided to adopt and legitimise\nit, we cannot declare it unconstitutional by importing our notions of\nwhat is right and wrong. The power to judge the fairness and\njustness of procedure established by a law for the purposes of\nArticle 21 is one thing: that power can be spelt out from the\nlanguage of that article. Procedural safeguards are the\nhandmaids of equal justice and since, the power of the\ngovernment is colossal as compared with the power of an\nindividual, the freedom of the individual can be safe only if he\nhas a guarantee that he will be treated fairly. The power to\ndecide upon the justness of the law itself is quite another\nthing: that power springs from a \u2018due process\u2019 provision such\nas is to be found in the 5th and 14th Amendments of the\nAmerican Constitution by which no person can be deprived of\nlife, liberty or property \u201cwithout due process of law\u201d.\u201d378\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn Saroj Rani v Sudarshan Kumar379, this Court upheld the constitutional validity of\nthe provision for restitution of conjugal rights contained in Section 9 of the Hindu\nMarriage Act, 1955. The Court found that the provision served a social purpose of\npreventing the breakdown of marriages and contained safeguards against its being\nused arbitrarily.\n378 Ibid, at page 301 (para 35)\n379 (1984) 4 SCC 90\n235\nPART Q\nIn Mohd. Arif v Supreme Court380, a Constitution Bench of this Court held that the\nexpression \u201creasonable procedure\u201d in the context of Article 21 would encompass an\noral hearing of review petitions arising out of death penalties. Tracing the history of\nthe evolution of Article 21, Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, speaking for the majority in\nthe Constitution Bench, observed as follows:\n\u201cThe wheel has turned full circle. Substantive due process is now to\nbe applied to the fundamental right to life and liberty.\u201d381\nMore recently, Justice Chelameswar, speaking for a Bench of two judges in Rajbala\nv State of Haryana382, has struck a note of caution, by drawing attention to the\nposition that the expression \u2018due process of law\u2019 was consciously deleted in the\ndrafting process after the framing of the Constitution. Hence, in the view of the learned\nJudge, it would be inappropriate to incorporate notions of substantive due process\nadopted in the US while examining the constitutionality of Indian legislation. The Court\nobserved:\n\u201cFrom the above extract from McDowell & Co. case it is clear that\nthe courts in this country do not undertake the task of\ndeclaring a piece of legislation unconstitutional on the ground\nthat the legislation is \u201carbitrary\u201d since such an exercise implies\na value judgment and courts do not examine the wisdom of\nsome specific provision of the Constitution. To undertake\nsuch an examination would amount to virtually importing the\ndoctrine of \u201csubstantive due process\u201d employed by the\nAmerican Supreme Court at an earlier point of time while\nexamining the constitutionality of Indian legislation. As pointed\nout in the above extract, even in United States the doctrine is\ncurrently of doubtful legitimacy. This Court long back in A.S.\n380 (2014) 9 SCC 737\n381 Ibid, at page 756 (para 28)\n382 (2016) 2 SCC 445\n236\nPART Q\nKrishna v. State of Madras [1957 SCR 399] declared that the\ndoctrine of due process has no application under the Indian\nConstitution. As pointed out by Frankfurter, J. arbitrariness became\na mantra.\u201d383 (emphasis supplied)\nThe constitutional history surrounding the drafting of Article 21 contains an abundant\nreflection of a deliberate and studied decision of the Constituent Assembly to delete\nthe expression \u2018due process of law\u2019 from the draft Constitution when the Constitution\nwas adopted. In the Constituent Assembly, the Drafting Committee chaired by Dr B\nR Ambedkar had included the phrase but it came to be deleted after a careful\nevaluation of the vagaries of the decision making process in the US involving\ninterpretation of the due process clause. Significantly, present to the mind of the\nframers of our Constitution was the invalidation of social welfare legislation in the US\non the anvil of the due process clause on the ground that it violated the liberty of\ncontract of men, women and children to offer themselves for work in a free market for\nlabour. This model evidently did not appeal to those who opposed the incorporation\nof a similar phrase into the Indian Constitution.\nYet the debates in the Constituent Assembly indicate that there was a substantial\nbody of opposition to the deletion of the due process clause, which eventually led Dr\nB R Ambedkar to objectively sum up the rival view points for decision by the House.\nEvidently \u2018due process\u2019 was substituted with the expression \u2018procedure established by\nlaw\u2019. \u2018Liberty\u2019 was qualified by \u2018personal\u2019.\n383 Ibid, at page 481 (para 64)\n237\nPART Q\nHaving noticed this, the evolution of Article 21, since the decision in Cooper indicates\ntwo major areas of change. First, the fundamental rights are no longer regarded as\nisolated silos or water tight compartments. In consequence, Article 14 has been held\nto animate the content of Article 21. Second, the expression \u2018procedure established\nby law\u2019 in Article 21 does not connote a formalistic requirement of a mere presence of\nprocedure in enacted law. That expression has been held to signify the content of the\nprocedure and its quality which must be fair, just and reasonable. The mere fact that\nthe law provides for the deprivation of life or personal liberty is not sufficient to\nconclude its validity and the procedure to be constitutionally valid must be fair, just\nand reasonable. The quality of reasonableness does not attach only to the content of\nthe procedure which the law prescribes with reference to Article 21 but to the content\nof the law itself. In other words, the requirement of Article 21 is not fulfilled only by the\nenactment of fair and reasonable procedure under the law and a law which does so\nmay yet be susceptible to challenge on the ground that its content does not accord\nwith the requirements of a valid law. The law is open to substantive challenge on the\nground that it violates the fundamental right.\nIn dealing with a substantive challenge to a law on the ground that it violates a\nfundamental right, there are settled principles of constitutional interpretation which\nhold the field. The first is the presumption of constitutionality384 which is based on the\n384 Charanjit Lal Chowdhury v. The Union of India, AIR 1951 SC 41 ; Ram Krishna Dalmia v.

The burden lies on the individual who\nasserts a constitutional transgression to establish it. Secondly, the Courts tread warily\nin matters of social and economic policy where they singularly lack expertise to make\nevaluations. Policy making is entrusted to the state.385\nThe doctrine of separation of powers requires the Court to allow deference to the\nlegislature whose duty it is to frame and enact law and to the executive whose duty it\nis to enforce law. The Court would not, in the exercise of judicial review, substitute its\nown opinion for the wisdom of the law enacting or law enforcing bodies. In the context\nof Article 19, the test of reasonableness was explained in the erudite words of Chief\nJustice Patanjali Sastri in State of Madras v V G Row386, where the learned Chief\nJustice held thus:\n\u201cIt is important in this context to bear in mind that the test of\nreasonableness, wherever prescribed, should be applied to each\nindividual statute impugned, and no abstract standard, or general\npattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all\ncases.

When\nthe validity of a law is questioned on the ground that it violates a guarantee contained\nin Article 21, the scope of the challenge is not confined only to whether the procedure\nfor the deprivation of life or personal liberty is fair, just and reasonable. Substantive\nchallenges to the validity of laws encroaching upon the right to life or personal liberty\nhas been considered and dealt with in varying contexts, such as the death penalty\n(Bachan Singh) and mandatory death sentence (Mithu), among other cases. A\nperson cannot be deprived of life or personal liberty except in accordance with the\nprocedure established by law. Article 14, as a guarantee against arbitrariness, infuses\nthe entirety of Article 21. The inter-relationship between the guarantee against\narbitrariness and the protection of life and personal liberty operates in a multi-faceted\nplane. First, it ensures that the procedure for deprivation must be fair, just and\nreasonable. Second, Article 14 impacts both the procedure and the expression \u201claw\u201d.\n387 Ibid, at page 607\n240\nPART Q\nA law within the meaning of Article 21 must be consistent with the norms of fairness\nwhich originate in Article 14. As a matter of principle, once Article 14 has a connect\nwith Article 21, norms of fairness and reasonableness would apply not only to the\nprocedure but to the law as well.\n166 Above all, it must be recognized that judicial review is a powerful guarantee\nagainst legislative encroachments on life and personal liberty. To cede this right would\ndilute the importance of the protection granted to life and personal liberty by the\nConstitution. Hence, while judicial review in constitutional challenges to the validity of\nlegislation is exercised with a conscious regard for the presumption of constitutionality\nand for the separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial\ninstitutions, the constitutional power which is vested in the Court must be retained as\na vibrant means of protecting the lives and freedoms of individuals.\n167 The danger of construing this as an exercise of \u2018substantive due process\u2019 is that\nit results in the incorporation of a concept from the American Constitution which was\nconsciously not accepted when the Constitution was framed. Moreover, even in the\ncountry of its origin, substantive due process has led to vagaries of judicial\ninterpretation. Particularly having regard to the constitutional history surrounding the\ndeletion of that phrase in our Constitution, it would be inappropriate to equate the\njurisdiction of a Constitutional Court in India to entertain a substantive challenge to the\nvalidity of a law with the exercise of substantive due process under the US\nConstitution. Reference to substantive due process in some of the judgments is\n241\nPART R\nessentially a reference to a substantive challenge to the validity of a law on the ground\nthat its substantive (as distinct from procedural) provisions violate the Constitution.\nR Essential nature of privacy\n168 What, then, does privacy postulate? Privacy postulates the reservation of a\nprivate space for the individual, described as the right to be let alone. The concept is\nfounded on the autonomy of the individual. The ability of an individual to make choices\nlies at the core of the human personality. The notion of privacy enables the individual\nto assert and control the human element which is inseparable from the personality of\nthe individual. The inviolable nature of the human personality is manifested in the\nability to make decisions on matters intimate to human life. The autonomy of the\nindividual is associated over matters which can be kept private. These are concerns\nover which there is a legitimate expectation of privacy. The body and the mind are\ninseparable elements of the human personality. The integrity of the body and the\nsanctity of the mind can exist on the foundation that each individual possesses an\ninalienable ability and right to preserve a private space in which the human personality\ncan develop. Without the ability to make choices, the inviolability of the personality\nwould be in doubt. Recognizing a zone of privacy is but an acknowledgment that each\nindividual must be entitled to chart and pursue the course of development of\npersonality. Hence privacy is a postulate of human dignity itself. Thoughts and\nbehavioural patterns which are intimate to an individual are entitled to a zone of\nprivacy where one is free of social expectations. In that zone of privacy, an individual\n242\nPART R\nis not judged by others. Privacy enables each individual to take crucial decisions which\nfind expression in the human personality. It enables individuals to preserve their\nbeliefs, thoughts, expressions, ideas, ideologies, preferences and choices against\nsocietal demands of homogeneity. Privacy is an intrinsic recognition of heterogeneity,\nof the right of the individual to be different and to stand against the tide of conformity\nin creating a zone of solitude. Privacy protects the individual from the searching glare\nof publicity in matters which are personal to his or her life. Privacy attaches to the\nperson and not to the place where it is associated. Privacy constitutes the foundation\nof all liberty because it is in privacy that the individual can decide how liberty is best\nexercised. Individual dignity and privacy are inextricably linked in a pattern woven out\nof a thread of diversity into the fabric of a plural culture.\n169 Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of dignity. Dignity has both an\nintrinsic and instrumental value. As an intrinsic value, human dignity is an entitlement\nor a constitutionally protected interest in itself. In its instrumental facet, dignity and\nfreedom are inseparably inter-twined, each being a facilitative tool to achieve the\nother. The ability of the individual to protect a zone of privacy enables the realization\nof the full value of life and liberty. Liberty has a broader meaning of which privacy is\na subset. All liberties may not be exercised in privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled only\nwithin a private space. Privacy enables the individual to retain the autonomy of the\nbody and mind. The autonomy of the individual is the ability to make decisions on\nvital matters of concern to life. Privacy has not been couched as an independent\nfundamental right. But that does not detract from the constitutional protection afforded\n243\nPART R\nto it, once the true nature of privacy and its relationship with those fundamental rights\nwhich are expressly protected is understood. Privacy lies across the spectrum of\nprotected freedoms. The guarantee of equality is a guarantee against arbitrary state\naction. It prevents the state from discriminating between individuals. The destruction\nby the state of a sanctified personal space whether of the body or of the mind is\nviolative of the guarantee against arbitrary state action. Privacy of the body entitles\nan individual to the integrity of the physical aspects of personhood. The intersection\nbetween one\u2019s mental integrity and privacy entitles the individual to freedom of\nthought, the freedom to believe in what is right, and the freedom of self-determination.\nWhen these guarantees intersect with gender, they create a private space which\nprotects all those elements which are crucial to gender identity. The family, marriage,\nprocreation and sexual orientation are all integral to the dignity of the individual.\nAbove all, the privacy of the individual recognises an inviolable right to determine how\nfreedom shall be exercised. An individual may perceive that the best form of\nexpression is to remain silent. Silence postulates a realm of privacy. An artist finds\nreflection of the soul in a creative endeavour. A writer expresses the outcome of a\nprocess of thought. A musician contemplates upon notes which musically lead to\nsilence. The silence, which lies within, reflects on the ability to choose how to convey\nthoughts and ideas or interact with others. These are crucial aspects of personhood.\nThe freedoms under Article 19 can be fulfilled where the individual is entitled to decide\nupon his or her preferences. Read in conjunction with Article 21, liberty enables the\nindividual to have a choice of preferences on various facets of life including what and\nhow one will eat, the way one will dress, the faith one will espouse and a myriad other\n244\nPART R\nmatters on which autonomy and self-determination require a choice to be made within\nthe privacy of the mind. The constitutional right to the freedom of religion under Article\n25 has implicit within it the ability to choose a faith and the freedom to express or not\nexpress those choices to the world. These are some illustrations of the manner in\nwhich privacy facilitates freedom and is intrinsic to the exercise of liberty. The\nConstitution does not contain a separate article telling us that privacy has been\ndeclared to be a fundamental right. Nor have we tagged the provisions of Part III with\nan alpha suffixed right of privacy: this is not an act of judicial redrafting. Dignity cannot\nexist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of life, liberty and\nfreedom which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of\nthe sanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across the\nspectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a zone of choice and\nself-determination.\nPrivacy represents the core of the human personality and recognizes the ability of\neach individual to make choices and to take decisions governing matters intimate and\npersonal. Yet, it is necessary to acknowledge that individuals live in communities and\nwork in communities. Their personalities affect and, in turn are shaped by their social\nenvironment. The individual is not a hermit. The lives of individuals are as much a\nsocial phenomenon. In their interactions with others, individuals are constantly\nengaged in behavioural patterns and in relationships impacting on the rest of society.\nEqually, the life of the individual is being consistently shaped by cultural and social\nvalues imbibed from living in the community. This state of flux which represents a\n245\nPART S\nconstant evolution of individual personhood in the relationship with the rest of society\nprovides the rationale for reserving to the individual a zone of repose. The lives which\nindividuals lead as members of society engender a reasonable expectation of privacy.\nThe notion of a reasonable expectation of privacy has elements both of a subjective\nand objective nature. Privacy at a subjective level is a reflection of those areas where\nan individual desire to be left alone. On an objective plane, privacy is defined by those\nconstitutional values which shape the content of the protected zone where the\nindividual ought to be left alone. The notion that there must exist a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy ensures that while on the one hand, the individual has a\nprotected zone of privacy, yet on the other, the exercise of individual choices is subject\nto the rights of others to lead orderly lives. For instance, an individual who possesses\na plot of land may decide to build upon it subject to zoning regulations. If the building\nbye laws define the area upon which construction can be raised or the height of the\nboundary wall around the property, the right to privacy of the individual is conditioned\nby regulations designed to protect the interests of the community in planned spaces.\nHence while the individual is entitled to a zone of privacy, its extent is based not only\non the subjective expectation of the individual but on an objective principle which\ndefines a reasonable expectation.\nS Informational privacy\n170 Ours is an age of information. Information is knowledge. The old adage that\n\u201cknowledge is power\u201d has stark implications for the position of the individual where\n246\nPART S\ndata is ubiquitous, an all-encompassing presence. Technology has made life\nfundamentally interconnected. The internet has become all pervasive as individuals\nspend more and more time online each day of their lives. Individuals connect with\nothers and use the internet as a means of communication. The internet is used to\ncarry on business and to buy goods and services. Individuals browse the web in\nsearch of information, to send e-mails, use instant messaging services and to\ndownload movies. Online purchases have become an efficient substitute for the daily\nvisit to the neighbouring store. Online banking has redefined relationships between\nbankers and customers. Online trading has created a new platform for the market in\nsecurities. Online music has refashioned the radio. Online books have opened up a\nnew universe for the bibliophile. The old-fashioned travel agent has been rendered\nredundant by web portals which provide everything from restaurants to rest houses,\nairline tickets to art galleries, museum tickets to music shows. These are but a few of\nthe reasons people access the internet each day of their lives. Yet every transaction\nof an individual user and every site that she visits, leaves electronic tracks generally\nwithout her knowledge. These electronic tracks contain powerful means of\ninformation which provide knowledge of the sort of person that the user is and her\ninterests388. Individually, these information silos may seem inconsequential. In\naggregation, they disclose the nature of the personality: food habits, language, health,\nhobbies, sexual preferences, friendships, ways of dress and political affiliation.

To put it\nmildly, privacy concerns are seriously an issue in the age of information.\n172 A Press Note released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on 3 July,\n2017389 is indicative of the prevalence of telecom services in India as on 31 December,\n2016.

The figures only increase.\n173 The age of information has resulted in complex issues for informational privacy.\nThese issues arise from the nature of information itself. Information has three facets:\nit is nonrivalrous, invisible and recombinant390. Information is nonrivalrous in the\nsense that there can be simultaneous users of the good \u2013 use of a piece of information\nby one person does not make it less available to another. Secondly, invasions of data\nprivacy are difficult to detect because they can be invisible. Information can be\naccessed, stored and disseminated without notice. Its ability to travel at the speed of\nlight enhances the invisibility of access to data, \u201cinformation collection can be the\nswiftest theft of all\u201d391. Thirdly, information is recombinant in the sense that data output\ncan be used as an input to generate more data output.\n390 Christina P. Moniodis, \u201cMoving from Nixon to NASA: Privacy \u2018s Second Strand- A Right to Informational\nPrivacy\u201d, Yale Journal of Law and Technology (2012), Vol. 15 (1), at page 153\n391 Ibid\n249\nPART S\n174 Data Mining processes together with knowledge discovery can be combined to\ncreate facts about individuals. Metadata and the internet of things have the ability to\nredefine human existence in ways which are yet fully to be perceived. This, as\nChristina Moniodis states in her illuminating article results in the creation of new\nknowledge about individuals; something which even she or he did not possess. This\nposes serious issues for the Court. In an age of rapidly evolving technology it is\nimpossible for a judge to conceive of all the possible uses of information or its\nconsequences:\n\u201c\u2026The creation of new knowledge complicates data privacy law as\nit involves information the individual did not possess and could not\ndisclose, knowingly or otherwise. In addition, as our state becomes\nan \u201cinformation state\u201d through increasing reliance on information \u2013\nsuch that information is described as the \u201clifeblood that sustains\npolitical, social, and business decisions. It becomes impossible to\nconceptualize all of the possible uses of information and resulting\nharms. Such a situation poses a challenge for courts who are\neffectively asked to anticipate and remedy invisible, evolving\nharms.\u201d 392\nThe contemporary age has been aptly regarded as \u201can era of ubiquitous dataveillance,\nor the systematic monitoring of citizen\u2019s communications or actions through the use\nof information technology\u201d393. It is also an age of \u201cbig data\u201d or the collection of data\nsets. These data sets are capable of being searched; they have linkages with other\ndata sets; and are marked by their exhaustive scope and the permanency of\ncollection.394 The challenges which big data poses to privacy interests emanate from\n392 Ibid, at page 154\n393 Yvonne McDermott, \u201cConceptualizing the right to data protection in an era of Big Data\u201d, Big Data and Society\n(2017), at page 1\n394 Ibid, at pages 1 and 4\n250\nPART S\nState and non-State entities. Users of wearable devices and social media networks\nmay not conceive of themselves as having volunteered data but their activities of use\nand engagement result in the generation of vast amounts of data about individual\nlifestyles, choices and preferences. Yvonne McDermott speaks about the quantified\nself in eloquent terms:\n\u201c\u2026The rise in the so-called \u2018quantified self\u2019, or the self-tracking of\nbiological, environmental, physical, or behavioural information\nthrough tracking devices, Internet-of-things devices, social network\ndata and other means (?Swan.2013) may result in information\nbeing gathered not just about the individual user, but about people\naround them as well. Thus, a solely consent-based model does not\nentirely ensure the protection of one\u2019s data, especially when data\ncollected for one purpose can be repurposed for another.\u201d395\n175 Daniel J Solove deals with the problem of \u201caggregation\u201d. Businesses and\ngovernments often aggregate a variety of information fragments, including pieces of\ninformation which may not be viewed as private in isolation to create a detailed portrait\nof personalities and behaviour of individuals.396 Yet, it is now a universally accepted\nfact that information and data flow are \u201cincreasingly central to social and economic\nordering\u201d397. Individuals are identified with reference to tax records, voting eligibility,\nand government-provided entitlements. There is what is now described as \u201c\u2018veillant\npanoptic assemblage\u2019, where data gathered through the ordinary citizen\u2019s veillance\n395 Ibid, at page 4\n396 Christina P.

It expresses a right to be left alone.\nA broader connotation which has emerged in academic literature of a comparatively\nrecent origin is related to the protection of one\u2019s identity. Data protection relates\nclosely with the latter sphere. Data such as medical information would be a category\nto which a reasonable expectation of privacy attaches. There may be other data which\nfalls outside the reasonable expectation paradigm. Apart from safeguarding privacy,\ndata protection regimes seek to protect the autonomy of the individual. This is evident\nfrom the emphasis in the European data protection regime on the centrality of consent.\nRelated to the issue of consent is the requirement of transparency which requires a\ndisclosure by the data recipient of information pertaining to data transfer and use.\n178 Another aspect which data protection regimes seek to safeguard is the principle\nof non-discrimination which ensures that the collection of data should be carried out\n398 Yvonne McDermott, \u201cConceptualizing the right to data protection in an era of Big Data\u201d, Big Data and Society\n(2017), at page 4.\n252\nPART S\nin a manner which does not discriminate on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political\nor religious beliefs, genetic or health status or sexual orientation.\n179 Formulation of a regime for data protection is a complex exercise which needs\nto be undertaken by the State after a careful balancing of the requirements of privacy\ncoupled with other values which the protection of data sub-serves together with the\nlegitimate concerns of the State. One of the chief concerns which the formulation of\na data protection regime has to take into account is that while the web is a source of\nlawful activity-both personal and commercial, concerns of national security intervene\nsince the seamless structure of the web can be exploited by terrorists to wreak havoc\nand destruction on civilised societies. Cyber attacks can threaten financial systems.\nRichard A Posner, in an illuminating article, has observed:\n\u201cPrivacy is the terrorist\u2019s best friend, and the terrorist\u2019s privacy has\nbeen enhanced by the same technological developments that have\nboth made data mining feasible and elicited vast quantities of\npersonal information from innocents: the internet, with its\nanonymity, and the secure encryption of digitized data which, when\ncombined with that anonymity, make the internet a powerful tool of\nconspiracy. The government has a compelling need to exploit\ndigitization in defense of national security\u2026\u201d399\nPosner notes that while \u201cpeople value their informational privacy\u201d, yet \u201cthey surrender\nit at the drop of a hat\u201d by readily sharing personal data in the course of simple daily\ntransactions. The paradox, he observes, can be resolved by noting that as long as\n399 Richard A. Posner, \u201cPrivacy, Surveillance, and Law\u201d, The University of Chicago Law Review (2008), Vol.75,\nat page 251\n253\nPART S\npeople do not expect that the details of their health, intimacies and finances among\nothers will be used to harm them in interaction with other people, they are content to\nreveal those details when they derive benefits from the revelation.400 As long as\nintelligence personnel can be trusted to use the knowledge gained only for the\ndefence of the nation, \u201cthe public will be compensated for the costs of diminished\nprivacy in increased security from terrorist attacks\u201d401. Posner\u2019s formulation would\nindicate that the State does have a legitimate interest when it monitors the web to\nsecure the nation against cyber attacks and the activities of terrorists.\n180 While it intervenes to protect legitimate state interests, the state must\nnevertheless put into place a robust regime that ensures the fulfilment of a three-fold\nrequirement. These three requirements apply to all restraints on privacy (not just\ninformational privacy). They emanate from the procedural and content-based\nmandate of Article 21. The first requirement that there must be a law in existence to\njustify an encroachment on privacy is an express requirement of Article 21. For, no\nperson can be deprived of his life or personal liberty except in accordance with the\nprocedure established by law. The existence of law is an essential requirement.\nSecond, the requirement of a need, in terms of a legitimate state aim, ensures that\nthe nature and content of the law which imposes the restriction falls within the zone of\nreasonableness mandated by Article 14, which is a guarantee against arbitrary state\naction. The pursuit of a legitimate state aim ensures that the law does not suffer from\n400 Ibid\n401 Ibid\n254\nPART S\nmanifest arbitrariness. Legitimacy, as a postulate, involves a value judgment. Judicial\nreview does not re-appreciate or second guess the value judgment of the legislature\nbut is for deciding whether the aim which is sought to be pursued suffers from palpable\nor manifest arbitrariness. The third requirement ensures that the means which are\nadopted by the legislature are proportional to the object and needs sought to be\nfulfilled by the law. Proportionality is an essential facet of the guarantee against\narbitrary state action because it ensures that the nature and quality of the\nencroachment on the right is not disproportionate to the purpose of the law. Hence,\nthe three-fold requirement for a valid law arises out of the mutual inter-dependence\nbetween the fundamental guarantees against arbitrariness on the one hand and the\nprotection of life and personal liberty, on the other. The right to privacy, which is an\nintrinsic part of the right to life and liberty, and the freedoms embodied in Part III is\nsubject to the same restraints which apply to those freedoms.\n181 Apart from national security, the state may have justifiable reasons for the\ncollection and storage of data. In a social welfare state, the government embarks\nupon programmes which provide benefits to impoverished and marginalised sections\nof society. There is a vital state interest in ensuring that scarce public resources are\nnot dissipated by the diversion of resources to persons who do not qualify as\nrecipients. Allocation of resources for human development is coupled with a legitimate\nconcern that the utilisation of resources should not be siphoned away for extraneous\npurposes. Data mining with the object of ensuring that resources are properly\ndeployed to legitimate beneficiaries is a valid ground for the state to insist on the\n255\nPART S\ncollection of authentic data. But, the data which the state has collected has to be\nutilised for legitimate purposes of the state and ought not to be utilised unauthorizedly\nfor extraneous purposes. This will ensure that the legitimate concerns of the state are\nduly safeguarded while, at the same time, protecting privacy concerns. Prevention\nand investigation of crime and protection of the revenue are among the legitimate\naims of the state. Digital platforms are a vital tool of ensuring good governance in a\nsocial welfare state. Information technology \u2013 legitimately deployed is a powerful\nenabler in the spread of innovation and knowledge.\n182 A distinction has been made in contemporary literature between anonymity on\none hand and privacy on the other.402 Both anonymity and privacy prevent others from\ngaining access to pieces of personal information yet they do so in opposite ways.\nPrivacy involves hiding information whereas anonymity involves hiding what makes it\npersonal. An unauthorised parting of the medical records of an individual which have\nbeen furnished to a hospital will amount to an invasion of privacy. On the other hand,\nthe state may assert a legitimate interest in analysing data borne from hospital records\nto understand and deal with a public health epidemic such as malaria or dengue to\nobviate a serious impact on the population. If the State preserves the anonymity of the\nindividual it could legitimately assert a valid state interest in the preservation of public\nhealth to design appropriate policy interventions on the basis of the data available to\nit.\n402 See in this connection, Jeffrey M. Skopek, \u201cReasonable Expectations of Anonymity\u201d, Virginia Law Review\n(2015), Vol.101, at pages 691-762\n256\nPART S\n183 Privacy has been held to be an intrinsic element of the right to life and personal\nliberty under Article 21 and as a constitutional value which is embodied in the\nfundamental freedoms embedded in Part III of the Constitution. Like the right to life\nand liberty, privacy is not absolute. The limitations which operate on the right to life\nand personal liberty would operate on the right to privacy. Any curtailment or\ndeprivation of that right would have to take place under a regime of law. The procedure\nestablished by law must be fair, just and reasonable. The law which provides for the\ncurtailment of the right must also be subject to constitutional safeguards.\n184 The Union government constituted a Group of Experts on privacy under the\nauspices of the erstwhile Planning Commission. The Expert Group in its Report403\n(dated 16 October 2012) proposed a framework for the protection of privacy concerns\nwhich, it was expected, would serve as a conceptual foundation for legislation\nprotecting privacy. The framework suggested by the expert group was based on five\nsalient features: (i) Technological neutrality and interoperability with international\nstandards; (ii) Multi-Dimensional privacy; (iii) Horizontal applicability to state and non-\nstate entities; (iv) Conformity with privacy principles; and (v) A co-regulatory\nenforcement regime. After reviewing international best practices, the Expert Group\nproposed nine privacy principles. They are:\n403 \u201cReport of the Group of Experts on Privacy\u201d (16 October, 2012), Government of India, available at\nhttp://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_privacy.pdf\n257\nPART S\n(i) Notice: A data controller shall give simple-to-understand notice of its information\npractices to all individuals in clear and concise language, before personal\ninformation is collected;\n(ii) Choice and Consent: A data controller shall give individuals choices (opt-in/opt-\nout) with regard to providing their personal information, and take individual\nconsent only after providing notice of its information practices;\n(iii) Collection Limitation: A data controller shall only collect personal information\nfrom data subjects as is necessary for the purposes identified for such collection,\nregarding which notice has been provided and consent of the individual taken.\nSuch collection shall be through lawful and fair means;\n(iv) Purpose Limitation: Personal data collected and processed by data controllers\nshould be adequate and relevant to the purposes for which it is processed. A data\ncontroller shall collect, process, disclose, make available, or otherwise use\npersonal information only for the purposes as stated in the notice after taking\nconsent of individuals. If there is a change of purpose, this must be notified to the\nindividual. After personal information has been used in accordance with the\nidentified purpose it should be destroyed as per the identified procedures. Data\nretention mandates by the government should be in compliance with the National\nPrivacy Principles;\n(v) Access and Correction: Individuals shall have access to personal information\nabout them held by a data controller; shall be able to seek correction,\namendments, or deletion of such information where it is inaccurate; be able to\nconfirm that a data controller holds or is processing information about them; be\n258\nPART S\nable to obtain from the data controller a copy of the personal data. Access and\ncorrection to personal information may not be given by the data controller if it is\nnot, despite best efforts, possible to do so without affecting the privacy rights of\nanother person, unless that person has explicitly consented to disclosure;\n(vi) Disclosure of Information: A data controller shall not disclose personal information\nto third parties, except after providing notice and seeking informed consent from\nthe individual for such disclosure. Third parties are bound to adhere to relevant\nand applicable privacy principles. Disclosure for law enforcement purposes must\nbe in accordance with the laws in force. Data controllers shall not publish or in any\nother way make public personal information, including personal sensitive\ninformation;\n(vii) Security: A data controller shall secure personal information that they have either\ncollected or have in their custody, by reasonable security safeguards against loss,\nunauthorised access, destruction, use, processing, storage, modification,\ndeanonymization, unauthorized disclosure [either accidental or incidental] or other\nreasonably foreseeable risks;\n(viii) Openness: A data controller shall take all necessary steps to implement\npractices, procedures, policies and systems in a manner proportional to the scale,\nscope, and sensitivity to the data they collect, in order to ensure compliance with\nthe privacy principles, information regarding which shall be made in an intelligible\nform, using clear and plain language, available to all individuals; and\n(ix) Accountability: The data controller shall be accountable for complying with\nmeasures which give effect to the privacy principles. Such measures should\n259\nPART T\ninclude mechanisms to implement privacy policies; including tools, training, and\neducation; external and internal audits, and requiring organizations or overseeing\nbodies extend all necessary support to the Privacy Commissioner and comply\nwith the specific and general orders of the Privacy Commissioner.\n185 During the course of the hearing of these proceedings, the Union government\nhas placed on the record an Office Memorandum dated 31 July 2017 by which it has\nconstituted a committee chaired by Justice B N Srikrishna, former Judge of the\nSupreme Court of India to review inter alia data protection norms in the country and\nto make its recommendations. The terms of reference of the Committee are :\na) To study various issues relating to data protection in India;\nb) To make specific suggestions for consideration of the Central Government\non principles to be considered for data protection in India and suggest a\ndraft data protection bill.\nSince the government has initiated the process of reviewing the entire area of data\nprotection, it would be appropriate to leave the matter for expert determination so that\na robust regime for the protection of data is put into place. We expect that the Union\ngovernment shall follow up on its decision by taking all necessary and proper steps.\nT Our Conclusions\n1 The judgment in M P Sharma holds essentially that in the absence of a provision\nsimilar to the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, the right to privacy cannot\n260\nPART T\nbe read into the provisions of Article 20 (3) of the Indian Constitution. The judgment\ndoes not specifically adjudicate on whether a right to privacy would arise from any\nof the other provisions of the rights guaranteed by Part III including Article 21 and\nArticle 19. The observation that privacy is not a right guaranteed by the Indian\nConstitution is not reflective of the correct position. M P Sharma is overruled to the\nextent to which it indicates to the contrary.\n2 Kharak Singh has correctly held that the content of the expression \u2018life\u2019 under\nArticle 21 means not merely the right to a person\u2019s \u201canimal existence\u201d and that the\nexpression \u2018personal liberty\u2019 is a guarantee against invasion into the sanctity of a\nperson\u2019s home or an intrusion into personal security. Kharak Singh also correctly\nlaid down that the dignity of the individual must lend content to the meaning of\n\u2018personal liberty\u2019. The first part of the decision in Kharak Singh which invalidated\ndomiciliary visits at night on the ground that they violated ordered liberty is an\nimplicit recognition of the right to privacy. The second part of the decision,\nhowever, which holds that the right to privacy is not a guaranteed right under our\nConstitution, is not reflective of the correct position. Similarly, Kharak Singh\u2019s\nreliance upon the decision of the majority in Gopalan is not reflective of the correct\nposition in view of the decisions in Cooper and in Maneka. Kharak Singh to the\nextent that it holds that the right to privacy is not protected under the Indian\nConstitution is overruled.\n261\nPART T\n3 (A) Life and personal liberty are inalienable rights. These are rights which are\ninseparable from a dignified human existence. The dignity of the individual,\nequality between human beings and the quest for liberty are the foundational pillars\nof the Indian Constitution;\n(B) Life and personal liberty are not creations of the Constitution. These rights are\nrecognised by the Constitution as inhering in each individual as an intrinsic and\ninseparable part of the human element which dwells within;\n(C) Privacy is a constitutionally protected right which emerges primarily from the\nguarantee of life and personal liberty in Article 21 of the Constitution. Elements of\nprivacy also arise in varying contexts from the other facets of freedom and dignity\nrecognised and guaranteed by the fundamental rights contained in Part III;\n(D) Judicial recognition of the existence of a constitutional right of privacy is not an\nexercise in the nature of amending the Constitution nor is the Court embarking on\na constitutional function of that nature which is entrusted to Parliament;\n(E) Privacy is the constitutional core of human dignity. Privacy has both a normative\nand descriptive function. At a normative level privacy sub-serves those eternal\nvalues upon which the guarantees of life, liberty and freedom are founded. At a\ndescriptive level, privacy postulates a bundle of entitlements and interests which\nlie at the foundation of ordered liberty;\n262\nPART T\n(F) Privacy includes at its core the preservation of personal intimacies, the sanctity of\nfamily life, marriage, procreation, the home and sexual orientation. Privacy also\nconnotes a right to be left alone. Privacy safeguards individual autonomy and\nrecognises the ability of the individual to control vital aspects of his or her life.\nPersonal choices governing a way of life are intrinsic to privacy. Privacy protects\nheterogeneity and recognises the plurality and diversity of our culture. While the\nlegitimate expectation of privacy may vary from the intimate zone to the private\nzone and from the private to the public arenas, it is important to underscore that\nprivacy is not lost or surrendered merely because the individual is in a public place.\nPrivacy attaches to the person since it is an essential facet of the dignity of the\nhuman being;\n(G) This Court has not embarked upon an exhaustive enumeration or a catalogue of\nentitlements or interests comprised in the right to privacy. The Constitution must\nevolve with the felt necessities of time to meet the challenges thrown up in a\ndemocratic order governed by the rule of law. The meaning of the Constitution\ncannot be frozen on the perspectives present when it was adopted. Technological\nchange has given rise to concerns which were not present seven decades ago\nand the rapid growth of technology may render obsolescent many notions of the\npresent. Hence the interpretation of the Constitution must be resilient and flexible\nto allow future generations to adapt its content bearing in mind its basic or\nessential features;\n263\nPART T\n(H) Like other rights which form part of the fundamental freedoms protected by Part\nIII, including the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21, privacy is not an\nabsolute right. A law which encroaches upon privacy will have to withstand the\ntouchstone of permissible restrictions on fundamental rights. In the context of\nArticle 21 an invasion of privacy must be justified on the basis of a law which\nstipulates a procedure which is fair, just and reasonable. The law must also be\nvalid with reference to the encroachment on life and personal liberty under Article\n21. An invasion of life or personal liberty must meet the three-fold requirement of\n(i) legality, which postulates the existence of law; (ii) need, defined in terms of a\nlegitimate state aim; and (iii) proportionality which ensures a rational nexus\nbetween the objects and the means adopted to achieve them; and\n(I) Privacy has both positive and negative content. The negative content restrains the\nstate from committing an intrusion upon the life and personal liberty of a citizen. Its\npositive content imposes an obligation on the state to take all necessary measures\nto protect the privacy of the individual.\n4 Decisions rendered by this Court subsequent to Kharak Singh, upholding the right\nto privacy would be read subject to the above principles.\n5 Informational privacy is a facet of the right to privacy. The dangers to privacy in\nan age of information can originate not only from the state but from non-state actors\nas well. We commend to the Union Government the need to examine and put into\nplace a robust regime for data protection. The creation of such a regime requires\n264\nPART T\na careful and sensitive balance between individual interests and legitimate\nconcerns of the state. The legitimate aims of the state would include for instance\nprotecting national security, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging\ninnovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing the dissipation of social\nwelfare benefits. These are matters of policy to be considered by the Union\ngovernment while designing a carefully structured regime for the protection of the\ndata. Since the Union government has informed the Court that it has constituted a\nCommittee chaired by Hon\u2019ble Shri Justice B N Srikrishna, former Judge of this\nCourt, for that purpose, the matter shall be dealt with appropriately by the Union\ngovernment having due regard to what has been set out in this judgment.\n6 The reference is answered in the above terms.\n...........................................CJI\n[JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR]\n..............................................J\n[R K AGRAWAL]\n..............................................J\n[Dr D Y CHANDRACHUD]\n265\nPART T\n.............................................J\n[S ABDUL NAZEER]\nNew Delhi;\nDated : 24, August 2017\n266"
