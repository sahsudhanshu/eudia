The\nminimum length of the dataset should be 20.\nAnalysis to be done:\nQ.1Descriptive Statistics\n1. Type of data, description of the data.\n2. For the data, compute the following:\na) Mean, Median, Mode and Variance\nb) Measure of Skewness and Kurtosis\n3. Create the following plots:\na) Histogram\nb) One of the following: Line chart/bar chart/pie chart/dot plot/ Stem and leaf plot/scatter plot (whichever is applicable)\nto visualize data.\nComment on your observations.\nQ.2Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\nGenerate a random sample from a given distribution for different sample sizes.\na) Plot its PMF/PDF and CDF.\nb) Calculate its first four sample moments and theoretical moments and compare the results.\nc) Show that the chosen distribution tends to the normal distribution/another distribution under certain conditions.\nMethod of Data Selection:\nMake use of your name or surname\u2019s initials to choose the data.\nExample 1: Vasudha Upadhyay\nData may be from the country Vietnam or Uruguay, or any other country starting with U or V.\nExample 2: Komal Yadav\nData may be related to Kidney Catheter replacements or the Survival time of Kidney patients.\nExample 3: Isha\nData may be related to insurance, such as insurance claims or infant mortality.\nAssignment Allotment Method\n(a) Method of selection of Programming language\n\u25cf R: If (Last 3 digits of Enrolment Number mod 3) = 0\n\u25cf Python: If (Last 3 digits of Enrolment Number mod 3) = 1\n\u25cf MATLAB: If (Last 3 digits of Enrolment Number mod 3) = 2\n(b) Method of Selection of Distribution for Q. 2, and for 2 c): Using the last digit of your Enrolment Number\n\u25cf 0: Binomial Distribution, 2c) Normal approximation to Binomial.\n\u25cf 1: Binomial Distribution, 2c) Poisson approximation to Binomial.\n\u25cf 2: Poisson Distribution, 2c) Normal approximation to Poisson.\n\u25cf 3: Negative Binomial Distribution, 2c) Normal approximation to Negative Binomial.\n\u25cf 4: Negative Binomial Distribution, 2c) Poisson approximation to Negative Binomial.\n\u25cf 5: Geometric Distribution, 2c) Normal approximation to Geometric.\n\u25cf 6: Gamma Distribution, 2c) Normal approximation to Gamma.\n\u25cf 7: Hypergeometric Distribution, 2c) Binomial approximation to Hypergeometric.\n\u25cf 8: Hypergeometric Distribution, 2c) Normal approximation to Hypergeometric.\n\u25cf 9: Hypergeometric Distribution 2c) Poisson approximation to Hypergeometric.\nIllustration:\nName: Vasudha Upadhyay\nEnrollment No.: RSS2023002\nCoding platform: Remainder of (002/3)=2 \u21d2 MATLAB\nDataset selected: Distribution of Ethnic groups among women in Vietnam in 2005.\nURL: https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/AIS3/AIS3.pdf\nBasis of data selection: Initial of my name.\nSolution to Q.1\nData Description: The dataset contains the distribution of 20 ethnic groups among women in Vietnam as per\nthe Vietnam AIS report, 2005.\nType of Data: Discrete\nSize of data: 20\nVisual representation: Histogram, Stem-and-Leaf Plot.\nFormulae Used: <<WRITE THE FORMULAE YOU\u2019VE USED:\n{\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52, \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 > >\nCode:<PASTE YOUR CODE HERE.>\nResults: Mean: 361.95\nMedian: 45\nMode: 1\nVariance: 1872597.8395\nCoefficient of Skewness: 16.9412\nCoefficient of Kurtosis: 17.9817\nHistogram Plot and Pie Chart of the data:\nObservations: From the statistics calculated, we see that Mean>Median>Mode. This implies that the data is\nheavily positively skewed. The high skewness in the data can also be observed by the high absolute value of the\ncoefficient of skewness. The variance has an abnormally high value, thereby indicating that the data is heavily\nscattered, i.e. there is a vast difference in the counts of the ethnic groups among Vietnamese women in 2005.\nThis scatteredness in the data is also visible from the histogram plot. We see that 19 values lie in the interval\n0-2000, while only one value lies in 6000-8000.\nThe high kurtosis value indicates a leptokurtic distribution, with values highly centered around the mean of the\ndata.\nSolution to Q.2\nLast digit of Enrolment Number: 2\nDistribution: Poisson\na) PMF and CDF plots of the Poisson Parameters: (5, 20, 100) for sample size 10000.\nCode:<PASTE YOUR CODE HERE.>\nPMF Plots for different values of \u03bb.\nCDF Plots for different values of \u03bb.\nb) Code:<PASTE YOUR CODE HERE.>\n--- Poisson(lambda = 5) ---\nSample size = 10000\nRaw 1st moment: sample = 4.9759, theoretical = 5.0000\nRaw 2nd moment: sample = 29.8577, theoretical = 30.0000\nRaw 3rd moment: sample = 205.1053, theoretical = 205.0000\nRaw 4th moment: sample = 1572.0125, theoretical = 1555.0000\n--- Poisson(lambda = 20) ---\nSample size = 10000\nRaw 1st moment: sample = 19.9455, theoretical = 20.0000\nRaw 2nd moment: sample = 417.4449, theoretical = 420.0000\nRaw 3rd moment: sample = 9124.1463, theoretical = 9220.0000\nRaw 4th moment: sample = 207461.8521, theoretical = 210820.0000\n--- Poisson(lambda = 100) ---\nSample size = 10000\nRaw 1st moment: sample = 100.0698, theoretical = 100.0000\nRaw 2nd moment: sample = 10113.5132, theoretical = 10100.0000\nRaw 3rd moment: sample = 1032101.0784, theoretical = 1030100.0000\nRaw 4th moment: sample = 106338227.8400, theoretical = 106070100.0000\nc) Normal approximation to Poisson: If the Poisson parameter \u03bb \u2265 10, then the normal approximation to\nPoisson can be used.\nCode:<PASTE YOUR CODE HERE.>\nResults:\nPoisson Parameters: 5, 20, 100.\nSample size: 10000.\n--- Poisson(lambda=5) ---\nSample size: 10000\nMean(Z): 0.0099 SD(Z): 1.0002\n--- Poisson(lambda=20) ---\nSample size: 10000\nMean(Z): 0.0011 SD(Z): 1.0060\n--- Poisson(lambda=100) ---\nSample size: 10000\nMean(Z): -0.0139 SD(Z): 0.9872\nFrom the graph shown above, we see that the Normal approximation to the Poisson distribution becomes better\nwith an increasing value of \u03bb."
